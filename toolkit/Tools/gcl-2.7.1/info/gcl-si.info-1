          (fill-pointer nil) (displaced-to nil) (displaced-index-offset
          0) static)
     Package:LISP

     Creates an array of the specified DIMENSIONS. The default for
     INITIAL- ELEMENT depends on ELEMENT-TYPE. MAKE-ARRAY will always
     try to find the 'best' array to accommodate the element-type
     specified.  For example on a SUN element-type (mod 1) -> bit
     (integer 0 10) -> unsigned-char (integer -3 10) -> signed-char
     si::best-array-element-type is the function doing this.  It is also
     used by the compiler, for coercing array element types.  If you are
     going to declare an array you should use the same element type as
     was used in making it.  eg (setq my-array (make-array 4
     :element-type '(integer 0 10))) (the (array (integer 0 10))
     my-array) When wanting to optimize references to an array you need
     to declare the array eg: (the (array (integer -3 10)) my-array) if
     ar were constructed using the (integer -3 10) element-type.  You
     could of course have used signed-char, but since the ranges may be
     implementation dependent it is better to use -3 10 range.
     MAKE-ARRAY needs to do some calculation with the element-type if
     you don't provide a primitive data-type.  One way of doing this in
     a machine independent fashion:

     (defvar *my-elt-type* #.  (array-element-type (make-array 1
     :element-type '(integer -3 10))))

     Then calls to (make-array n :element-type *my-elt-type*) will not
     have to go through a type inclusion computation.  The keyword
     STATIC (GCL specific) if non nil, will cause the array body to be
     non relocatable.

          string)))

 -- Function: OPEN (filename &key (direction :input) (element-type
          'string-char) (if-exists :error) (if-does-not-exist :error))
     Package:LISP

     Opens the file specified by FILENAME, which may be a string, a
     pathname, or a stream.  Returns a stream for the open file.
     DIRECTION is :INPUT, :OUTPUT, :IO or :PROBE. ELEMENT-TYPE is
     STRING-CHAR, (UNSIGNED-BYTE n), UNSIGNED-BYTE, (SIGNED-BYTE n),
     SIGNED-BYTE, CHARACTER, BIT, (MOD n), or :DEFAULT. IF-EXISTS is
     :ERROR, :NEW-VERSION, :RENAME, :RENAME-AND-DELETE, :OVERWRITE,
     :APPEND, :SUPERSEDE, or NIL. IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST is :ERROR, :CREATE,
     or NIL.

     If FILENAME begins with a vertical pipe sign: '|' then the
     resulting stream is actually a one way pipe.  It will be open for
     reading or writing depending on the direction given.  The rest of
     FILENAME in this case is passed to the /bin/sh command.  See the
     posix description of popen for more details.
          (setq pipe (open "| wc < /tmp/jim"))

     corresponding INIT, and then executes STATEMENTs repeatedly until
     ENDTEST is satisfied.  After each iteration, assigns to each VAR
     the value of the corresponding STEP. When ENDTEST is satisfied,
     evaluates RESULTs as a PROGN and returns the value(s) of the last
     RESULT (or NIL if no RESULTs are supplied).  Performs variable
     bindings and assignments all at once, just like LET and PSETQ do.

 -- Function: READ-FROM-STRING (string &optional (eof-error-p t)

     because of the lack of such mechanism in the underlying operating
     system.

 -- Function: MAKE-PATHNAME (&key (defaults (parse-namestring ""
          (pathname-host *default-pathname-defaults*))) (host
          (pathname-host defaults)) (device (pathname-device defaults))
          (directory (pathname-directory defaults)) (name (pathname-name
          defaults)) (type (pathname-type defaults)) (version

 -- Function: READ-LINE (&optional (stream *standard-input*)
          (eof-error-p t) (eof-value nil) (recursive-p nil))
     Package:LISP

     Returns a line of text read from STREAM as a string, discarding the
     newline character.

     Note that when using line at a time input under unix, input forms
     will always be followed by a #\newline.  Thus if you do

     >(read-line) "" nil

     the empty string will be returned.  After lisp reads the
     (read-line) it then invokes (read-line).  This happens before it
     does anything else and so happens before the newline character
     immediately following (read-line) has been read.  Thus read-line
     immediately encounters a #\newline and so returns the empty string.
     If there had been other characters before the #\newline it would
     have been different:

     >(read-line) how are you " how are you" nil

     If you want to throw away "" input, you can do that with the
     following:

     (sloop::sloop while (equal (setq input (read-line)) ""))

     You may also want to use character at a time input, but that makes
     input editing harder.  nicolas% stty cbreak nicolas% gcl GCL (GNU

     the output is returned in a string as the value of the call.
     Otherwise, DESTINATION must be a stream to which the output will be
     sent.

     CONTROL-STRING is a string to be output, possibly with embedded
     formatting directives, which are flagged with the escape character
     "~".  Directives generally expand into additional text to be
     output, usually consuming one or more of ARGUMENTs in the process.

     A few useful directives are:

          ~A, ~nA, ~n@A	Prints one argument as if by PRINC
          ~S, ~nS, ~n@S	Prints one argument as if by PRIN1
          ~D, ~B, ~O, ~X	Prints one integer in decimal, binary, octal, and hexa
          ~%		Does TERPRI
          ~&		Does FRESH-LINE

     where n is the minimal width of the field in which the object is
     printed.  ~nA and ~nS put padding spaces on the right; ~n@A and
     ~n@S put on the left.

          ~R  is for printing numbers in various formats.

            ~nR   prints arg in radix n.
            ~R    prints arg as a cardinal english number: two
            ~:R   prints arg as an ordinal english number: third
            ~@R   prints arg as an a Roman Numeral: VII
            ~:@R   prints arg as an old Roman Numeral: IIII

          ~C prints a character.
            ~:C represents non printing characters by their pretty names,eg Space
            ~@C uses the #\ syntax to allow the reader to read it.

          ~F prints a floating point number arg.
            The full form is ~w,d,k,overflowchar,padcharF
            w represents the total width of the printed representation (variable if
              not present)
            d the number of fractional digits to display
              (format nil "~,2f" 10010.0314) --> "10010.03"
            k arg is multiplied by 10^k before printing it as a decimal number.
            overflowchar width w characters copies of the overflow character will
              be printed.   eg(format t "X>~5,2,,'?F<X" 100.034) --> X>?????<X
            padchar is the character to pad with
              (format t "X>~10,2,1,'?,'bF<X" 100.03417) -->X>bbb1000.34<X
            @ makes + sign print if the arg is positive

          ~@[print-if-true~]
     if arg is not nil, then it is retained as an arg for further
     printing, otherwise it is used up

             (format nil "~@[x = ~d~]~a" nil 'bil) --> "BIL"
             (format nil "~@[x = ~d ~]~a" 8) --> "x = 8 BIL"

     function doc of PPRINT for more information about pretty-printing.

 -- Function: FILE-WRITE-DATE (file)
     Package:LISP

     Returns the time at which the specified file is written, as an
     integer in universal time format.  FILE may be a string or a
     stream.

 -- Function: PRIN1-TO-STRING (object)
     Package:LISP

     Returns as a string the printed representation of OBJECT in the
     mostly readable representation.  Equivalent to (WRITE-TO-STRING
     OBJECT :ESCAPE T).

 -- Function: MERGE-PATHNAMES (pathname &optional (defaults
          *default-pathname-defaults*) default-version)
     Package:LISP

     Fills in unspecified slots of PATHNAME from DEFAULTS.
     DEFAULT-VERSION is ignored in GCL.

 -- Function: READ-BYTE (stream &optional (eof-error-p t) (eof-value
          nil))
     Package:LISP

     Reads the next byte from STREAM.

 -- Function: PRINC-TO-STRING (object)
     Package:LISP

     Returns as a string the printed representation of OBJECT without
     escape characters.  Equivalent to (WRITE-TO-STRING OBJECT :ESCAPE
     NIL).

     Outputs STRING and then outputs a newline character.  Returns
     STRING.

 -- Function: WRITE (object &key (stream *standard-output*) (escape
          *print-escape*) (radix *print-radix*) (base *print-base*)
          (circle *print-circle*) (pretty *print-pretty*) (level
          *print-level*) (length *print-length*) (case *print-case*)
          (array *print-array*) (gensym *print-gensym*))

     object's representation is CHAR. Returns a list of the objects
     read.

 -- Function: READLINE-ON ()
     Package:SI

     Begins readline command editing mode when possible.  In addition to
     the basic readline editing features, command word completion is
     implemented according to the following scheme:

     [[pkg]:[:]]txt

     pkg - an optional package specifier.  Defaults to the current
     package.  The symbols in this package and those in the packages in
     this package's use list will be searched.

     :[:] - an optional internal/external specifier.  Defaults to
     external.  The keyword package is denoted by a single colon at the
     beginning of the token.  Only symbols of this type will be searched
     for completion.

     txt - a string.  Symbol names beginning with this string are
     completed.  The comparison is case insensitive.

 -- Function: READLINE-OFF ()
     Package:SI

     Disables readline command editing mode.

 -- Variable: *READLINE-PREFIX*
     Package:SI

     A string implicitly prepended to input text for use in readline
     command completion.  If this string contains one or more colons, it
     is used to specify the default package and internal/external
     setting for searched symbols in the case that the supplied text
     itself contains no explicit package specification.  If this string
     contains characters after the colon(s), or contains no colons at
     all, it is treated as a symbol name prefix.  In this case, the
     prefix is matched first, then the supplied text, and the completion
     returned is relative to the supplied text itself, i.e.  contains no
     prefix.  For example, the setting "maxima::$" will complete input
     text "int" according to the internal symbols in the maxima package
     of the form "maxima::$int...", and return suggestions to the user
     of the form "int...".

     signals a correctable error.

 -- Function: MACROEXPAND (form &optional (env nil))
     Package:LISP

     If FORM is a macro form, then expands it repeatedly until it is not
     a macro any more.  Returns two values: the expanded form and a

     SETF doc and can be retrieved by (documentation 'NAME 'setf).

          (defsetf access-fun update-fun) defines an expansion from
          (setf (ACCESS-FUN arg1 ... argn) value) to (UPDATE-FUN arg1 ... argn value).

          (defsetf access-fun lambda-list (store-var) . body) defines a macro which

     an error.

 -- Special Form: LET*
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (let* ({var | (var [value])}*) {decl}* {form}*)

     defaults to NIL) from left to right, then evaluates FORMs as a
     PROGN.

 -- Special Form: PROG1
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (prog1 first {form}*)

     Evaluates FIRST and FORMs in order, and returns the (single) value
     of FIRST.

 -- Special Form: DEFUN
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defun name lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)

     Defines a function as the global function definition of the symbol
     NAME. The complete syntax of a lambda-list is: ({var}* [&optional
     {var | (var [initform [svar]])}*] [&rest var] [&key {var | ({var |
     (keyword var)} [initform [svar]])}* [&allow-other-keys]] [&aux {var
     | (var [initform])}*]) The doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved as
     a FUNCTION doc and can be retrieved by (documentation 'NAME
     'function).

 -- Special Form: MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (multiple-value-bind ({var}*) values-form {decl}* {form}*)

     (defaulting to NIL) and evaluates FORMs in order.

 -- Special Form: DECLARE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (declare {decl-spec}*)

     Gives a declaration.  Possible DECL-SPECs are: (SPECIAL {var}*)
     (TYPE type {var}*) where 'TYPE' is one of the following symbols
          array		fixnum		package		simple-bit-vector
          atom		float		pathname	simple-string
          bignum		function	random-state	simple-vector
          bit		hash-table	ratio		single-float
          bit-vector	integer		rational	standard-char
          character	keyword		readtable	stream

          complex		nil		signed-byte	symbol
          cons		null		unsigned-byte	t
          double-float	number		simple-array	vector
     'TYPE' may also be a list containing one of the above symbols as
     its first element and more specific information later in the list.
     For example
          (vector long-float 80) ; vector of 80 long-floats.
          (array long-float *)   ; array of long-floats
          (array fixnum)         ; array of fixnums
          (array * 30)           ; an array of length 30 but unspecified type

     A list of 1 element may be replaced by the symbol alone, and a list
     ending in '*' may drop the the final '*'.
          (OBJECT {var}*)
          (FTYPE type {function-name}*)
              eg: ;; function of two required args and optional args and one value:
               (ftype (function (t t *) t) sort reduce)
                  ;; function with 1 arg of general type returning 1 fixnum as value.
               (ftype (function (t) fixnum) length)
          (FUNCTION function-name ({arg-type}*) {return-type}*)
          (INLINE {function-name}*)
          (NOTINLINE {function-name}*)
          (IGNORE {var}*)
          (OPTIMIZE {({SPEED | SPACE | SAFETY | COMPILATION-SPEED} {0 | 1 | 2 | 3})}*)
          (DECLARATION {non-standard-decl-name}*)
          (:DYNAMIC-EXTENT {var}*) ;GCL-specific.

 -- Special Form: DEFMACRO
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defmacro name defmacro-lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)

     Defines a macro as the global macro definition of the symbol NAME.
     The complete syntax of a defmacro-lambda-list is:

     ( [&whole var] [&environment var] {pseudo-var}* [&optional {var |
     (pseudo-var [initform [pseudo-var]])}*] {[{&rest | &body}
     pseudo-var] [&key {var | ({var | (keyword pseudo-var)} [initform
     [pseudo-var]])}* [&allow-other-keys]] [&aux {var | (pseudo-var
     [initform])}*] | .  var})

     where pseudo-var is either a symbol or a list of the following
     form:

     ( {pseudo-var}* [&optional {var | (pseudo-var [initform
     [pseudo-var]])}*] {[{&rest | &body} pseudo-var] [&key {var | ({var
     | (keyword pseudo-var)} [initform [pseudo-var]])}* [
     &allow-other-keys ] ] [&aux {var | (pseudo-var [initform])}*] | .
     var})

     As a special case, a non-NIL symbol is accepcted as a
     defmacro-lambda-list: (DEFMACRO <name> <symbol> ...)  is equivalent
     to (DEFMACRO <name> (&REST <symbol>) ...).  The doc-string DOC, if
     supplied, is saved as a FUNCTION doc and can be retrieved by
     (documentation 'NAME 'function).  See the type doc of LIST for the
     backquote macro useful for defining macros.  Also, see the function
     doc of PPRINT for the output-formatting.

 -- Variable: *EVALHOOK*
     Package:LISP If *EVALHOOK* is not NIL, its value must be a function
     that can receive two arguments: a form to evaluate and an
     environment.  This function does the evaluation instead of EVAL.

 -- Function: FUNCTIONP (x)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if X is a function, suitable for use by FUNCALL or APPLY.
     Returns NIL otherwise.

 -- Constant: LAMBDA-PARAMETERS-LIMIT
     Package:LISP The exclusive upper bound on the number of distinct
     parameter names that may appear in a single lambda-list.  Actually,
     however, there is no such upper bound in GCL.

 -- Special Form: FLET
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (flet ({(name lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)}*) . body)

     Evaluates BODY as a PROGN, with local function definitions in
     effect.  BODY is the scope of each local function definition.
     Since the scope does not include the function definitions
     themselves, the local function can reference externally defined
     functions of the same name.  See the doc of DEFUN for the complete
     syntax of a lambda-list.  Doc-strings for local functions are
     simply ignored.

 -- Macro: ECASE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (ecase keyform {({key | ({key}*)} {form}*)}*)

     Evaluates KEYFORM and tries to find the KEY that is EQL to the
     value of KEYFORM. If one is found, then evaluates FORMs that follow
     the KEY and returns the value(s) of the last FORM. If not, signals
     an error.

 -- Special Form: PROG2
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (prog2 first second {forms}*)

     Evaluates FIRST, SECOND, and FORMs in order, and returns the
     (single) value of SECOND.

 -- Special Form: PROGV
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (progv symbols values {form}*)

     SYMBOLS must evaluate to a list of variables.  VALUES must evaluate
     to a list of initial values.  Evaluates FORMs as a PROGN, with each
     variable bound (as special) to the corresponding value.

 -- Special Form: QUOTE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (quote x)
     or 'x Simply returns X without evaluating it.

 -- Special Form: DOTIMES
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (dotimes (var countform [result]) {decl}* {tag | statement}*)

     Executes STATEMENTs, with VAR bound to each number between 0
     (inclusive) and the value of COUNTFORM (exclusive).  Then returns
     the value(s) of RESULT (which defaults to NIL).

 -- Function: SPECIAL-FORM-P (symbol)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if SYMBOL globally names a special form; NIL otherwise.
     The special forms defined in Steele's manual are:
          block		if			progv
          catch		labels			quote
          compiler-let	let			return-from
          declare		let*			setq
          eval-when	macrolet		tagbody
          flet		multiple-value-call	the
          function	multiple-value-prog1	throw
          go		progn			unwind-protect

     In addition, GCL implements the following macros as special forms,
     though of course macro-expanding functions such as MACROEXPAND work
     correctly for these macros.

          and		incf			prog1
          case		locally			prog2
          cond		loop			psetq
          decf		multiple-value-bind	push
          defmacro	multiple-value-list	return
          defun		multiple-value-set	setf
          do		or			unless
          do*		pop			when
          dolist		prog
          dotimes		prog*

 -- Special Form: FUNCTION
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (function x)
     or #'x If X is a lambda expression, creates and returns a lexical
     closure of X in the current lexical environment.  If X is a symbol
     that names a function, returns that function.

 -- Constant: MULTIPLE-VALUES-LIMIT
     Package:LISP The exclusive upper bound on the number of values that
     may be returned from a function.  Actually, however, there is no
     such upper bound in GCL.

 -- Function: APPLYHOOK (function args evalhookfn applyhookfn &optional
          (env nil))
     Package:LISP

     Applies FUNCTION to ARGS, with *EVALHOOK* bound to EVALHOOKFN and
     with *APPLYHOOK* bound to APPLYHOOKFN. Ignores the hook function
     once, for the top-level application of FUNCTION to ARGS.

 -- Variable: *MACROEXPAND-HOOK*
     Package:LISP Holds a function that can take two arguments (a macro
     expansion function and the macro form to be expanded) and returns
     the expanded form.  This function is whenever a macro-expansion
     takes place.  Initially this is set to #'FUNCALL.

 -- Special Form: PROG*
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (prog* ({var | (var [init])}*) {decl}* {tag | statement}*)

     Creates a NIL block, binds VARs sequentially, and then executes
     STATEMENTs.

 -- Special Form: BLOCK
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (block name {form}*)

     The FORMs are evaluated in order, but it is possible to exit the
     block using (RETURN-FROM name value).  The RETURN-FROM must be
     lexically contained within the block.

 -- Special Form: PROGN
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (progn {form}*)

     Evaluates FORMs in order, and returns whatever the last FORM
     returns.

 -- Function: APPLY (function arg &rest more-args)
     Package:LISP

     Applies FUNCTION. The arguments to the function consist of all ARGs
     except for the last, and all elements of the last ARG.

 -- Special Form: LABELS
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (labels ({(name lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)}*) . body)

     Evaluates BODY as a PROGN, with the local function definitions in
     effect.  The scope of the locally defined functions include the
     function definitions themselves, so their definitions may include
     recursive references.  See the doc of DEFUN for the complete syntax
     of a lambda-list.  Doc-strings for local functions are simply
     ignored.

 -- Special Form: RETURN
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (return [result])

     Returns from the lexically surrounding NIL block.  The value of
     RESULT, which defaults to NIL, is returned as the value of the
     block.

 -- Macro: TYPECASE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (typecase keyform {(type {form}*)}*)

     Evaluates KEYFORM and tries to find the TYPE in which the value of
     KEYFORM belongs.  If one is found, then evaluates FORMs that follow
     the KEY and returns the value of the last FORM. If not, simply
     returns NIL.

 -- Special Form: AND
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (and {form}*)

     Evaluates FORMs in order from left to right.  If any FORM evaluates
     to NIL, returns immediately with the value NIL. Else, returns the
     value(s) of the last FORM.

 -- Special Form: LET
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (let ({var | (var [value])}*) {decl}* {form}*)

     Initializes VARs, binding them to the values of VALUEs (which
     defaults to NIL) all at once, then evaluates FORMs as a PROGN.

 -- Special Form: COND
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (cond {(test {form}*)}*)
     Evaluates each TEST in order until one evaluates to a non-NIL
     value.  Then evaluates the associated FORMs in order and returns
     the value(s) of the last FORM. If no forms follow the TEST, then
     returns the value of the TEST. Returns NIL, if all TESTs evaluate
     to NIL.

 -- Function: GET-SETF-METHOD-MULTIPLE-VALUE (form)
     Package:LISP Returns the five values (or five 'gangs') constituting
     the SETF method for FORM. See the doc of DEFINE-SETF-METHOD for the
     meanings of the gangs.  The third value (i.e., the list of store
     variables) may consist of any number of elements.  See the doc of
     GET-SETF-METHOD for comparison.

 -- Special Form: CATCH
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (catch tag {form}*)

     Sets up a catcher with that value TAG. Then evaluates FORMs as a
     PROGN, but may possibly abort the evaluation by a THROW form that
     specifies the value EQ to the catcher tag.

 -- Macro: DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (define-modify-macro name lambda-list fun [doc])

     Defines a read-modify-write macro, like PUSH and INCF. The defined
     macro will expand a form (NAME place val1 ...  valn) into a form
     that in effect SETFs the value of the call (FUN PLACE arg1 ...
     argm) into PLACE, where arg1 ...  argm are parameters in
     LAMBDA-LIST which are bound to the forms VAL1 ...  VALn.  The
     doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved as a FUNCTION doc and can be
     retrieved by (documentation 'NAME 'function).

 -- Function: MACROEXPAND-1 (form &optional (env nil))
     Package:LISP

     If FORM is a macro form, then expands it once.  Returns two values:
     the expanded form and a T-or-NIL flag indicating whether the
     original form was a macro.

 -- Function: FUNCALL (function &rest arguments)
     Package:LISP

     Applies FUNCTION to the ARGUMENTs

 -- Constant: CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT
     Package:LISP The upper exclusive bound on the number of arguments
     that may be passed to a function.  Actually, however, there is no
     such upper bound in GCL.

 -- Special Form: CASE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (case keyform {({key | ({key}*)} {form}*)}*)

     Evaluates KEYFORM and tries to find the KEY that is EQL to the
     value of KEYFORM. If one is found, then evaluates FORMs that follow
     the KEY and returns the value(s) of the last FORM. If not, simply
     returns NIL.

 -- Macro: DEFINE-SETF-METHOD
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (define-setf-method access-fun defmacro-lambda-list {decl | doc}*
                    {form}*)

     Defines how to SETF a generalized-variable reference of the form
     (ACCESS-FUN ...).  When a form (setf (ACCESS-FUN arg1 ...  argn)
     value) is being evaluated, the FORMs are first evaluated as a PROGN
     with the parameters in DEFMACRO-LAMBDA-LIST bound to ARG1 ...
     ARGn.  Assuming that the last FORM returns five values (temp-var-1
     ...  temp-var-k) (value-from-1 ...  value-form-k) (store-var)
     storing-form access-form in order, the whole SETF is then expanded
     into (let* ((temp-var-1 value-from-1) ...  (temp-k value-form-k)
     (store-var VALUE)) storing-from) Incidentally, the five values are
     called the five gangs of a SETF method.  The doc-string DOC, if
     supplied, is saved as a SETF doc and can be retrieved by
     (documentation 'NAME 'setf).

 -- Special Form: COMPILER-LET
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (compiler-let ({var | (var [value])}*) {form}*)

     When interpreted, this form works just like a LET form with all
     VARs declared special.  When compiled, FORMs are processed with the
     VARs bound at compile time, but no bindings occur when the compiled
     code is executed.

 -- Function: VALUES (&rest args)
     Package:LISP

     Returns ARGs in order, as values.

 -- Special Form: MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST
     Package:LISP

 -- Special Form: MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (multiple-value-prog1 form {form}*)

     Evaluates the first FORM, saves all the values produced, then
     evaluates the other FORMs.  Returns the saved values.

 -- Special Form: MACROLET
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (macrolet ({(name defmacro-lambda-list {decl | doc}* . body)}*)
                    {form}*)

     Evaluates FORMs as a PROGN, with the local macro definitions in
     effect.  See the doc of DEFMACRO for the complete syntax of a
     defmacro-lambda-list.  Doc-strings for local macros are simply
     ignored.

 -- Special Form: GO
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (go tag)

     Jumps to the specified TAG established by a lexically surrounding
     TAGBODY.

 -- Special Form: PROG
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (prog ({var | (var [init])}*) {decl}* {tag | statement}*)

     Creates a NIL block, binds VARs in parallel, and then executes
     STATEMENTs.

 -- Variable: *APPLYHOOK*
     Package:LISP Used to substitute another function for the implicit
     APPLY normally done within EVAL. If *APPLYHOOK* is not NIL, its
     value must be a function which takes three arguments: a function to
     be applied, a list of arguments, and an environment.  This function
     does the application instead of APPLY.

 -- Special Form: RETURN-FROM
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (return-from name [result])

     Returns from the lexically surrounding block whose name is NAME.
     The value of RESULT, which defaults to NIL, is returned as the
     value of the block.

 -- Special Form: UNLESS
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (unless test {form}*)

     If TEST evaluates to NIL, then evaluates FORMs as a PROGN. If not,
     simply returns NIL.

 -- Special Form: MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (multiple-value-setq variables form)

     Sets each variable in the list VARIABLES to the corresponding value
     of FORM. Returns the value assigned to the first variable.

 -- Special Form: LOCALLY
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (locally {decl}* {form}*)

     Gives local pervasive declarations.

 -- Function: IDENTITY (x)
     Package:LISP

     Simply returns X.

 -- Function: NOT (x)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if X is NIL; NIL otherwise.

 -- Macro: DEFCONSTANT
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defconstant name initial-value [doc])

     Declares that the variable NAME is a constant whose value is the
     value of INITIAL-VALUE. The doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved
     as a VARIABLE doc and can be retrieved by (documentation 'NAME
     'variable).

 -- Function: VALUES-LIST (list)
     Package:LISP

     Returns all of the elements of LIST in order, as values.

 -- Function: ERROR (control-string &rest args)
     Package:LISP

     Signals a fatal error.

 -- Special Form: IF
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (if test then [else])

     If TEST evaluates to non-NIL, then evaluates THEN and returns the
     result.  If not, evaluates ELSE (which defaults to NIL) and returns
     the result.

 -- Special Form: UNWIND-PROTECT
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (unwind-protect protected-form {cleanup-form}*)

     Evaluates PROTECTED-FORM and returns whatever it returned.
     Guarantees that CLEANUP-FORMs be always evaluated before exiting
     from the UNWIND-PROTECT form.

 -- Function: EVALHOOK (form evalhookfn applyhookfn &optional (env nil))
     Package:LISP

     Evaluates FORM with *EVALHOOK* bound to EVALHOOKFN and *APPLYHOOK*
     bound to APPLYHOOKFN. Ignores these hooks once, for the top-level
     evaluation of FORM.

 -- Special Form: OR
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (or {form}*)

     Evaluates FORMs in order from left to right.  If any FORM evaluates
     to non-NIL, quits and returns that (single) value.  If the last
     FORM is reached, returns whatever values it returns.

 -- Macro: CTYPECASE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (ctypecase keyplace {(type {form}*)}*)

     Evaluates KEYPLACE and tries to find the TYPE in which the value of
     KEYPLACE belongs.  If one is found, then evaluates FORMs that
     follow the KEY and returns the value(s) of the last FORM. If not,
     signals a correctable error.

 -- Function: EVAL (exp)
     Package:LISP

     Evaluates EXP and returns the result(s).

 -- Macro: PSETF
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (psetf {place newvalue}*)

     Similar to SETF, but evaluates all NEWVALUEs first, and then
     replaces the value in each PLACE with the value of the
     corresponding NEWVALUE. Returns NIL always.

 -- Special Form: THROW
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (throw tag result)

     Evaluates TAG and aborts the execution of the most recent CATCH
     form that sets up a catcher with the same tag value.  The CATCH
     form returns whatever RESULT returned.

 -- Macro: DEFPARAMETER
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defparameter name initial-value [doc])

     Declares the variable NAME as a special variable and initializes
     the value.  The doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved as a VARIABLE
     doc and can be retrieved by (documentation 'NAME 'variable).

     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defvar name [initial-value [doc]])

     Declares the variable NAME as a special variable and, optionally,
     initializes it.  The doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved as a

7 Compilation
*************

 -- Function: COMPILE (name &optional (definition nil))
     Package:LISP

     If DEFINITION is NIL, NAME must be the name of a not-yet-compiled
     function.  In this case, COMPILE compiles the function, installs
     the compiled function as the global function definition of NAME,
     and returns NAME. If DEFINITION is non-NIL, it must be a lambda
     expression and NAME must be a symbol.  COMPILE compiles the lambda
     expression, installs the compiled function as the function
     definition of NAME, and returns NAME. There is only one exception
     for this: If NAME is NIL, then the compiled function is not
     installed but is simply returned as the value of COMPILE. In any
     case, COMPILE creates temporary files whose filenames are
     "gazonk***".  By default, i.e.  if :LEAVE-GAZONK is not supplied or
     is NIL, these files are automatically deleted after compilation.

 -- Function: LINK (files image &optional post extra-libs (run-user-init
          t) &aux raw init)
     Package:LISP

     On systems where dlopen is used for relocations, one cannot make
     custom images containing loaded binary object files simply by
     loading the files and executing save-system.  This function is
     provided for such cases.

     After compiling source files into objects, LINK can be called with
     a list of binary and source FILES which would otherwise normally be
     loaded in sequence before saving the image to IMAGE. LINK will use
     the system C linker to link the binary files thus supplied with
     GCL's objects, using EXTRA-LIBS as well if provided, and producing
     a raw_IMAGE executable.  This executable is then run to initialize
     first GCL's objects, followed by the supplied files, in order, if
     RUN-USER-INIT is set.  In such a case, source files are loaded at
     their position in the sequence.  Any optional code which should be
     run after file initialization can be supplied in the POST variable.
     The image is then saved using save-system to IMAGE.

     This method of creating lisp images may also have the advantage
     that all new object files are kept out of the lisp core and placed
     instead in the final image's .text section.  This should in
     principle reduce the core size, speed up garbage collection, and
     forego any performance penalty induced by data cache flushing on
     some machines.

     In both the RAW and SAVED image, any calls to LOAD binary object
     files which have been specified in this list will bypass the normal
     load procedure, and simply initialize the already linked in module.
     One can rely on this feature by disabling RUN-USER-INIT, and
     instead passing the normal build commands in POST. In the course of
     executing this code, binary modules previously linked into the
     .text section of the executable will be initialized at the same
     point at which they would have normally been loaded into the lisp
     core, in the executable's .data section.  In this way, the user can
     choose to take advantage of the aforementioned possible benefits of
     this linking method in a relatively transparent way.

     All binary objects specified in FILES must have been compiled with
     :SYSTEM-P set to T.

 -- Special Form: EVAL-WHEN
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (eval-when ({situation}*) {form}*)

     A situation must be either COMPILE, LOAD, or EVAL. The interpreter
     evaluates only when EVAL is specified.  If COMPILE is specified,
     FORMs are evaluated at compile time.  If LOAD is specified, the
     compiler arranges so that FORMs be evaluated when the compiled code
     is loaded.

 -- Function: COMPILE-FILE (input-pathname &key output-file (load nil)
          (message-file nil) ;GCL specific keywords: system-p c-debug
          c-file h-file data-file)
     Package:LISP

     Compiles the file specified by INPUT-PATHNAME and generates a fasl
     file specified by OUTPUT-FILE. If the filetype is not specified in
     INPUT-PATHNAME, then ".lsp" is used as the default file type for
     the source file.  :LOAD specifies whether to load the generated
     fasl file after compilation.  :MESSAGE-FILE specifies the log file
     for the compiler messages.  It defaults to the value of the
     variable COMPILER:*DEFAULT-MESSAGE-FILE*.  A non-NIL value of
     COMPILER::*COMPILE-PRINT* forces the compiler to indicate the form
     currently being compiled.  More keyword parameters are accepted,
     depending on the version.  Most versions of GCL can receive
     :O-FILE, :C-FILE, :H-FILE, and :DATA-FILE keyword parameters, with
     which you can control the intermediate files generated by the GCL
     compiler.  Also :C-DEBUG will pass the -g flag to the C compiler.

     By top level forms in a file, we mean the value of
     *top-level-forms* after doing (TF form) for each form read from a
     file.  We define TF as follows:

     (defun TF (x) (when (consp x) (setq x (macroexpand x)) (when (consp
     x) (cond ((member (car x) '(progn eval-when)) (mapcar 'tf (cdr x)))
     (t (push x *top-level-forms*))))))

     Among the common lisp special forms only DEFUN and DEFMACRO will
     cause actual native machine code to be generated.  The rest will be
     specially treated in an init section of the .data file.  This is
     done so that things like putprop,setq, and many other forms would
     use up space which could not be usefully freed, if we were to
     compile to native machine code.  If you have other 'ordinary' top
     level forms which you need to have compiled fully to machine code
     you may either set compiler::*COMPILE-ORDINARIES* to t, or put them
     inside a

     (PROGN 'COMPILE ...forms-which-need-to-be-compiled)

     The compiler will take each of them and make a temporary function
     which will be compiled and invoked once.  It is permissible to wrap
     a (PROGN 'COMPILE ..)  around the whole file.  Currently this
     construction binds the compiler::*COMPILE-ORDINARIES* flag to t.
     Setting this flag globally to a non nil value to cause all top
     level forms to generate machine code.  This might be useful in a
     system such as PCL, where a number of top level lambda expressions
     are given.  Note that most common lisps will simply ignore the top
     level atom 'compile, since it has no side effects.

     Defentry, clines, and defcfun also result in machine code being
     generated.

subsection Evaluation at Compile time
*************************************

In GCL the eval-when behaviour was changed in order to allow more
efficient init code, and also to bring it into line with the resolution
passed by the X3j13 committee.  Evaluation at compile time is controlled
by placing eval-when special forms in the code, or by the value of the
variable compiler::*eval-when-defaults* [default value :defaults].  If
that variable has value :defaults, then the following hold:

   Eval at Compile Type of Top Level Form

Partial:
     defstructs, defvar, defparameter
Full:
     defmacro, defconstant, defsetf, define-setf-method, deftype,
     package ops, proclaim
None:
     defun, others

   By 'partial' we mean (see the X3J13 Common Lisp document
(doc/compile-file-handling-of-top-level-forms) for more detail), that
functions will not be defined, values will not be set, but other
miscellaneous compiler properties will be set: eg properties to inline
expand defstruct accessors and testers, defstruct properties allowing
subsequent defstructs to include this one, any type hierarch
information, special variable information will be set up.

   Example:
     (defun foo () 3)
     (defstruct jo a b)

   As a side effect of compiling these two forms, foo would not have its
function cell changed.  Neither would jo-a, although it would gain a
property which allows it to expand inline to a structure access.  Thus
if it had a previous definition (as commonly happens from previously
loading the file), this previous definition would not be touched, and
could well be inconsistent with the compiler properties.  Unfortunately
this is what the CL standard says to do, and I am just trying to follow
it.

   If you prefer a more intuitive scheme, of evaling all forms in the
file, so that there are no inconsistencies, (previous behaviour of AKCL)
you may set compiler::*eval-when-defaults* to '(compile eval load).

   The variable compiler::*FASD-DATA* [default t] controls whether an
ascii output is used for the data section of the object file.  The data
section will be in ascii if *fasd-data* is nil or if the system-p
keyword is supplied to compile-file and *fasd-data* is not eq to
:system-p.

   The old GCL variable *compile-time-too* has disappeared.

   See OPTIMIZE on how to enable warnings of slow constructs.

 -- Function: PROCLAIM (decl-spec)
     Package:LISP

     Puts the declaration given by DECL-SPEC into effect globally.  See
     the doc of DECLARE for possible DECL-SPECs.

 -- Function: PROVIDE (module-name)
     Package:LISP

     Adds the specified module to the list of modules maintained in
     *MODULES*.

 -- Function: COMPILED-FUNCTION-P (x)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if X is a compiled function; NIL otherwise.

 -- Function: GPROF-START ()
     Package:SYSTEM

     GCL now has preliminary support for profiling with gprof, an
     externally supplied profiling tool at the C level which typically
     accompanies gcc.  Support must be enabled at compile time with
     -enable-gprof.  This function starts the profiling timers and
     counters.

 -- Function: GPROF-QUIT ()
     Package:SYSTEM

     GCL now has preliminary support for profiling with gprof, an
     externally supplied profiling tool at the C level which typically
     accompanies gcc.  Support must be enabled at compile time with
     -enable-gprof.  This function reports the profiling results in the
     form of a call graph to standard output, and clears the profiling
     arrays.  Please note that lisp functions are not (yet) displayed
     with their lisp names.  Please see also the PROFILE function.

 -- Function: GPROF-SET (begin end)
     Package:SYSTEM

     GCL now has preliminary support for profiling with gprof, an
     externally supplied profiling tool at the C level which typically
     accompanies gcc.  Support must be enabled at compile time with
     -enable-gprof.  This function sets the address range used by
     GPROF-START in specifying the section of the running program which
     is to be profiled.  All subsequent calls to GPROF-START will use
     this new address range.  By default, the range is set to begin at
     the starting address of the .text section, and to end at the
     current end of the running core.  These default values can be
     restored by calling GPROF-SET with both argments set to 0.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-SYSTEM-P*
     Package:COMPILER Specifies the default setting of :SYSTEM-P used by
     COMPILE. Defaults to NIL.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-C-FILE*
     Package:COMPILER Specifies the default setting of :C-FILE used by
     COMPILE. Defaults to NIL.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-H-FILE*
     Package:COMPILER Specifies the default setting of :H-FILE used by
     COMPILE. Defaults to NIL.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-DATA-FILE*
     Package:COMPILER Specifies the default setting of :DATA-FILE used
     by COMPILE. Defaults to NIL.

 -- Variable: *FEATURES*
     Package:LISP List of symbols that name features of the current
     version of GCL. These features are used to decide the read-time
     conditionalization facility provided by '#+' and '#-' read macros.
     When the GCL reader encounters
          	#+ feature-description form
     it reads FORM in the usual manner if FEATURE-DESCRIPTION is true.
     Otherwise, the reader just skips FORM.
          	#- feature-description form
     is equivalent to
          	#- (not feature-description) form
     A feature-description may be a symbol, which is true only when it
     is an element of *FEATURES*.  Or else, it must be one of the
     following:
          (and feature-desciption-1 ... feature-desciption-n)
          (or  feature-desciption-1 ... feature-desciption-n)
          (not feature-desciption)
     The AND description is true only when all of its sub-descriptions
     are true.  The OR description is true only when at least one of its
     sub-descriptions is true.  The NOT description is true only when
     its sub-description is false.

8 Symbols
*********

 -- Function: GENSYM (&optional (x nil))
     Package:LISP

     Creates and returns a new uninterned symbol whose name is a prefix
     string (defaults to "G"), followed by a decimal number.  The number
     is incremented by each call to GENSYM. X, if an integer, resets the
     counter.  If X is a string, it becomes the new prefix.

* Operating System Definitions::
* Environment Variables::


File: gcl-si.info,  Node: Command Line,  Next: Operating System Definitions,  Prev: Operating System,  Up: Operating System

9.1 Command Line
================

The variable si::*command-args* is set to the list of strings passed in
when gcl is invoked.

   Various flags are understood.
‘-eval’
     Call read and then eval on the command argument following ‘-eval’
‘-load’
     Load the file whose pathname is specified after ‘-load’.
‘-f’
     Replace si::*command-args* by the the list starting after ‘-f’.
     Open the file following ‘-f’ for input, skip the first line, and
     then read and eval the rest of the forms in the file.  This can be
     used as with the shells to write small shell programs:
          #!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f
          (format t "hello world ~a~%" (nth 1 si::*command-args*))
     The value si::*command-args* will have the appropriate value.  Thus
     if the above 2 line file is made executable and called ‘foo’ then
          tutorial% foo billy
          hello world billy
     NOTE: On many systems (eg SunOs) the first line of an executable
     script file such as:
          #!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f
     only reads the first 32 characters!  So if your pathname where the
     executable together with the '-f' amount to more than 32 characters
     the file will not be recognized.  Also the executable must be the
     actual large binary file, [or a link to it], and not just a
     ‘/bin/sh’ script.  In latter case the ‘/bin/sh’ interpreter would
     get invoked on the file.

     Alternately one could invoke the file ‘foo’ without making it
     executable:
          tutorial% gcl -f foo "from bill"
          hello world from bill

     Finally perhaps the best way (why do we save the best for last..  I
     guess because we only figure it out after all the others..)  The
     following file ‘myhello’ has 4 lines:
          #!/bin/sh
          #| Lisp will skip the next 2 lines on reading
          exec gcl   -f "$0" $ |#
          (format t "hello world ~a~%" (nth 1 si::*command-args*))

          marie% chmod a+x myhello
          marie% myhello bill
          hello world bill

     The advantage of this method is that ‘gcl’ can itself be a shell
     script, which sets up environment and so on.  Also the normal path
     will be searched to find ‘gcl’ The disadvantage is that this would
     cause 2 invocations of ‘sh’ and one invocation of ‘gcl’.  The plan
     using ‘gcl.exe’ bypasses the ‘sh’ entirely.  Inded invoking
     ‘gcl.exe’ to print ‘hello world’ is faster on most systems than a
     similar ‘csh’ or ‘bash’ script, but slightly slower than the old
     ‘sh’.

‘-batch’
     Do not enter the command print loop.  Useful if the other command
     line arguments do something.  Do not print the License and
     acknowledgement information.  Note if your program does print any
     License information, it must print the GCL header information also.
‘-dir’
     Directory where the executable binary that is running is located.
     Needed by save and friends.  This gets set as
     si::*system-directory*
‘-libdir’
             -libdir /d/wfs/gcl-2.0/
     would mean that the files like gcl-tk/tk.o would be found by
     concatting the path to the libdir path, ie in
          /d/wfs/gcl-2.0/gcl-tk/tk.o
‘-compile’
     Invoke the compiler on the filename following ‘-compile’.  Other
     flags affect compilation.
‘-o-file’
     If nil follows ‘-o-file’ then do not produce an ‘.o’ file.
‘-c-file’
     If ‘-c-file’ is specified, leave the intermediate ‘.c’ file there.
‘-h-file’
     If ‘-h-file’ is specified, leave the intermediate ‘.h’ file there.
‘-data-file’
     If ‘-data-file’ is specified, leave the intermediate ‘.data’ file
     there.
‘-system-p’
     If ‘-system-p’ is specified then invoke ‘compile-file’ with the
     ‘:system-p t’ keyword argument, meaning that the C init function
     will bear a name based on the name of the file, so that it may be
     invoked by name by C code.

**********************

 -- Macro: DO-EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (do-external-symbols (var [package [result-form]])
                    {decl}* {tag | statement}*)

     Executes STATEMENTs once for each external symbol in the PACKAGE
     (which defaults to the current package), with VAR bound to the
     current symbol.  Then evaluates RESULT-FORM (which defaults to NIL)
     and returns the value(s).

 -- Special Form: DO*
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (do* ({(var [init [step]])}*) (endtest {result}*)
                    {decl}* {tag | statement}*)

     Just like DO, but performs variable bindings and assignments in
     serial, just like LET* and SETQ do.

 -- Macro: DO-ALL-SYMBOLS
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (do-all-symbols (var [result-form]) {decl}* {tag | statement}*)

     Package:LISP

     Asks the user a question whose answer is either 'YES' or 'NO'. If
     FORMAT- STRING is non-NIL, then FRESH-LINE operation is performed,
     a message is printed as if FORMAT-STRING and ARGs were given to
     FORMAT, and then a prompt "(Yes or No)" is printed.  Otherwise, no
     prompt will appear.

 -- Function: MAPHASH #'hash-table
     Package:LISP

     For each entry in HASH-TABLE, calls FUNCTION on the key and value
     of the entry; returns NIL.

     defaults to the current package), with VAR bound to the current
     symbol.  Then evaluates RESULT-FORM (which defaults to NIL) and
     returns the value(s).

 -- Special Form: LOOP
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (loop {form}*)

     Executes FORMs repeatedly until exited by a THROW or RETURN. The
     FORMs are surrounded by an implicit NIL block.

     Traces the specified functions.  With no FUNCTION-NAMEs, returns a
     list of functions currently being traced.

     Additional Keywords are allowed in GCL with the syntax (trace {fn |
     (fn {:kw form}*)}*)

     For each FN naming a function, traces that function.  Each :KW
     should be one of the ones listed below, and FORM should have the
     corresponding form.  No :KW may be given more than once for the
     same FN. Returns a list of all FNs now traced which weren't already
     traced.

     EXAMPLE (Try this with your favorite factorial function FACT):

          ;; print entry args and exit values

          (trace FACT)

          ;; Break coming out of FACT if the value is bigger than 1000.

          (trace (fact :exit
          	     (progn
          	       (if (> (car values) 1000)(break "big result"))
          	       (car values))))

          ;; Hairy example:

          ;;make arglist available without the si:: prefix
          (import 'si::arglist)

          (trace (fact
                  :DECLARATIONS
                  ((in-string "Here comes input: ")
                   (out-string "Here comes output: ")
                   all-values
                   (silly (+ 3 4)))
                  :COND
                  (equal (rem (car arglist) 2) 0)
                  :ENTRY
                  (progn
                    (cond
                     ((equal (car arglist) 8)
                      (princ "Entering FACT on input 8!! ")
                      (setq out-string "Here comes output from inside (FACT 8): "))
                     (t
                      (princ in-string)))
                    (car arglist))
                  :EXIT
                  (progn
                    (setq all-values (cons (car values) all-values))
                    (princ out-string)
                    (when (equal (car arglist) 8)
                          ;; reset out-string
                          (setq out-string "Here comes output: "))
                    (cons 'fact values))
                  :ENTRYCOND
                  (not (= (car arglist) 6))
                  :EXITCOND
                  (not (= (car values) (* 6 (car arglist))))
                  :DEPTH
                  5))

     Syntax is ‘:keyword’ form1 ‘:keyword’ form2 ...

     ‘:declarations’
               DEFAULT: NIL

          FORM is ((var1 form1 )(var2 form2 )...), where the var_i are
          symbols distinct from each other and from all symbols which
          are similarly declared for currently traced functions.  Each
          form is evaluated immediately.  Upon any invocation of a
          traced function when not already inside a traced function
          call, each var is bound to that value of form .

     ‘:COND’
               DEFAULT: T

          Here, FORM is any Lisp form to be evaluated (by EVAL) upon
          entering a call of FN, in the environment where si::ARGLIST is
          bound to the current list of arguments of FN. Note that even
          if the evaluation of FORM changes the value of SI::ARGLIST
          (e.g.  by evaluation of (SETQ si::ARGLIST ...)), the list of
          arguments passed to FN is unchanged.  Users may alter args
          passed by destructively modifying the list structure of
          SI::ARGLIST however.  The call is traced (thus invoking the
          :ENTRYCOND and :EXITCOND forms, at least) if and only if FORM
          does not evaluate to NIL.

     ‘:ENTRYCOND’
               DEFAULT: T

          This is evaluated (by EVAL) if the :COND form evaluates to
          non-NIL, both in an environment where SI::ARGLIST is bound to
          the current list of arguments of FN. If non-NIL, the :ENTRY
          form is then evaluated and printed with the trace "prompt".

     ‘:ENTRY’
               DEFAULT: (CONS (QUOTE x) SI::ARGLIST),

          where x is the symbol we call FN If the :COND and :ENTRYCOND
          forms evaluate to non-NIL, then the trace "prompt" is printed
          and then this FORM is evaluated (by EVAL) in an environment
          where SI::ARGLIST is bound to the current list of arguments of
          FN. The result is then printed.

     ‘:EXITCOND’
               DEFAULT: T

          This is evaluated (by EVAL) in the environment described below
          for the :EXIT form.  The :EXIT form is then evaluated and
          printed with the "prompt" if and only if the result here is
          non-NIL.

     ‘:EXIT’
               DEFAULT: (CONS (QUOTE x) VALUES),

          where x is the symbol we call FN Upon exit from tracing a
          given call, this FORM is evaluated (after the appropriate
          trace "prompt" is printed), using EVAL in an environment where
          SI::ARGLIST is bound to the current list of arguments of FN
          and VALUES is bound to the list of values returned by FN
          (recalling that Common Lisp functions may return multiple
          values).

     ‘:DEPTH’
               DEFAULT:  No depth limit

          FORM is simply a positive integer specifying the maximum
          nesting of traced calls of FN, i.e.  of calls of FN in which
          the :COND form evaluated to non-NIL. For calls of FN in which
          this limit is exceeded, even the :COND form is not evaluated,
          and the call is not traced.

 -- Function: APROPOS (string &optional (package nil))
     Package:LISP

     Prints those symbols whose print-names contain STRING as substring.
     If PACKAGE is non-NIL, then only the specified package is searched.

 -- Function: INFO (string &optional (list-of-info-files
          *default-info-files*))
     PACKAGE:SI

     Find all documentation about STRING in LIST-OF-INFO-FILES. The
     search is done for STRING as a substring of a node name, or for
     STRING in the indexed entries in the first index for each info
     file.  Typically that should be a variable and function definition
     index, if the info file is about a programming language.  If the
     windowing system is connected, then a choice box is offered and
     double clicking on an item brings up its documentation.

     Otherwise a list of choices is offered and the user may select some
     of these choices.

     list-of-info-files is of the form
           ("gcl-si.info" "gcl-tk.info" "gcl.info")
     The above list is the default value of *default-info-files*, a
     variable in the SI package.  To find these files in the file
     system, the search path *info-paths* is consulted as is the master
     info directory ‘dir’.

     see *Index *default-info-files*:: and *Index *info-paths*::.  For
     example
          (info "defun")

           0: DEFUN :(gcl-si.info)Special Forms and Functions.
           1: (gcl.info)defun.
          Enter n, all, none, or multiple choices eg 1 3 : 1

          Info from file /home/wfs/gcl-doc/gcl.info:
          defun                                                               [Macro]
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
          `Defun'  function-name lambda-list [[{declaration}* | documentation]]
          ...

     would list the node ‘(gcl.info)defun’.  That is the node entitled
     ‘defun’ from the info file gcl.info.  That documentation is based
     on the ANSI common lisp standard.  The choice
          DEFUN :(gcl-si.info)Special Forms and Functions.

     refers to the documentation on DEFUN from the info file gcl-si.info
     in the node Special Forms And Functions.  This is an index
     reference and only the part of the node which refers to ‘defun’
     will be printed.

          (info "factor" '("maxima.info"))
     would search the maxima info files index and nodes for ‘factor’.

 -- Variable: *info-paths*
     Package SI:

     A list of strings such as
            '("" "/usr/info/" "/usr/local/lib/info/" "/usr/local/info/"
              "/usr/local/gnu/info/" )
     saying where to look for the info files.  It is used implicitly by
     ‘info’, see *Index info::.

     Looking for maxima.info would look for the file maxima.info in all
     the directories listed in *info-paths*.  If nto found then it would
     look for ‘dir’ in the *info-paths* directories, and if it were
     found it would look in the ‘dir’ for a menu item such as

          * maxima: (/home/wfs/maxima-5.0/info/maxima.info).

     If such an entry exists then the directory there would be used for
     the purpose of finding ‘maxima.info’

14 Type
*******

 -- Function: COERCE (x type)
     Package:LISP

     Coerces X to an object of the type TYPE.

 -- Function: TYPE-OF (x)
     Package:LISP

     Returns the type of X.

 -- Function: CONSTANTP (symbol)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if the variable named by SYMBOL is a constant; NIL
     otherwise.

 -- Function: TYPEP (x type)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if X is of the type TYPE; NIL otherwise.

 -- Function: COMMONP (x)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if X is a Common Lisp object; NIL otherwise.

 -- Function: SUBTYPEP (type1 type2)
     Package:LISP

     Returns T if TYPE1 is a subtype of TYPE2; NIL otherwise.  If it
     could not determine, then returns NIL as the second value.
     Otherwise, the second value is T.

 -- Macro: CHECK-TYPE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (check-type place typespec [string])

     Signals an error, if the contents of PLACE are not of the specified
     type.

 -- Macro: ASSERT
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (assert test-form [({place}*) [string {arg}*]])

     Signals an error if the value of TEST-FORM is NIL. STRING is an
     format string used as the error message.  ARGs are arguments to the
     format string.

 -- Macro: DEFTYPE
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (deftype name lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)

     Defines a new type-specifier abbreviation in terms of an
     'expansion' function (lambda lambda-list1 {decl}* {form}*) where
     lambda-list1 is identical to LAMBDA-LIST except that all optional
     parameters with no default value specified in LAMBDA-LIST defaults
     to the symbol '*', but not to NIL. When the type system of GCL
     encounters a type specifier (NAME arg1 ...  argn), it calls the
     expansion function with the arguments arg1 ...  argn, and uses the
     returned value instead of the original type specifier.  When the
     symbol NAME is used as a type specifier, the expansion function is
     called with no argument.  The doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved
     as the TYPE doc of NAME, and is retrieved by (documentation 'NAME
     'type).

 -- Declaration: DYNAMIC-EXTENT
     Package:LISP Declaration to allow locals to be cons'd on the C
     stack.  For example (defun foo (&rest l) (declare (:dynamic-extent
     l)) ...)  will cause l to be a list formed on the C stack of the
     foo function frame.  Of course passing L out as a value of foo will
     cause havoc.  (setq x (make-list n)) (setq x (cons a b)) (setq x
     (list a b c ..))  also are handled on the stack, for dynamic-extent
     x.

15 GCL Specific
***************

 -- Function: SYSTEM (string)
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Executes a Shell command as if STRING is an input to
     the Shell.  Not all versions of GCL support this function.  At
     least on POSIX systems, this call should return two integers
     represeting the exit status and any possible terminating signal
     respectively.

 -- Variable: *TMP-DIR*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Directory in which temporary
     "gazonk" files used by the compiler are to be created.

 -- Variable: *IGNORE-MAXIMUM-PAGES*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Tells the GCL memory manager whether
     (non-NIL) or not (NIL) it should expand memory whenever the maximum
     allocatable pages have been used up.

 -- Variable: *OPTIMIZE-MAXIMUM-PAGES*
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Tells the GCL memory manager whether to attempt to
     adjust the maximum allowable pages for each type to approximately
     optimize the garbage collection load in the current process.
     Defaults to T. Set to NIL if you care more about memory usage than
     runtime.

 -- Function: MACHINE-VERSION ()
     Package:LISP

     Returns a string that identifies the machine version of the machine
     on which GCL is currently running.

 -- Function: BY ()
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Exits from GCL.

 -- Macro: DEFCFUN
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defcfun header n {element}*)

     GCL specific: Defines a C-language function which calls Lisp
     functions and/or handles Lisp objects.  HEADER gives the header of
     the C function as a string.  Non-negative-integer is the number of
     the main stack entries used by the C function, primarily for
     protecting Lisp objects from being garbage-collected.  Each ELEMENT
     may give a C code fragment as a string, or it may be a list
     ((symbol {arg}*) {place}*) which, when executed, calls the Lisp
     function named by SYMBOL with the specified arguments and saves the
     value(s) to the specified places.  The DEFCFUN form has the above
     meanings only after compiled; The GCL interpreter simply ignores
     this form.

     An example which defines a C function list2 of two arguments, but
     which calls the 'lisp' function CONS by name, and refers to the
     constant 'NIL. Note to be loaded by ‘load’ the function should be
     static.

     (defCfun "static object list2(x,y) object x,y;" 0 "object z;" ('NIL
     z) ((CONS y z) z) ((CONS x z) z) "return(z);" )

     In lisp the operations in the body would be (setq z 'nil) (setq z
     (cons y z)) (setq z (cons x z))

     Syntax:

                  (defCfun header non-negative-integer
                          { string
                            | ( function-symbol { value }* )
                            | (( function-symbol  { value }* ) { place }* ) })


          value:
          place:
                   { C-expr | ( C-type C-expr ) }

          C-function-name:
          C-expr:
                   { string | symbol }

          C-type:
                   { object | int | char | float | double }


 -- Macro: CLINES
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (clines {string}*)

     GCL specific: The GCL compiler embeds STRINGs into the intermediate
     C language code.  The interpreter ignores this form.

 -- Function: SET-LOG-MAXPAGE-BOUND (positive-integer)
     Package:SYSTEM

     GCL specific: Limits the heap to 1<<(positive-integer+1) bytes.
     Trumps any limits specified in the environment.

 -- Function: ALLOCATE (type number &optional (really-allocate nil))
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Sets the maximum number of pages for the type class
     of the GCL implementation type TYPE to NUMBER. If REALLY-ALLOCATE
     is given a non-NIL value, then the specified number of pages will
     be allocated immediately.

 -- Function: GBC (x)
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Invokes the garbage collector (GC) with the
     collection level specified by X. NIL as the argument causes GC to
     collect cells only.  T as the argument causes GC to collect
     everything.

 -- Function: SAVE (pathname)
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Saves the current GCL core image into a program file
     specified by PATHNAME. This function depends on the version of GCL.
     The function si::save-system is to be preferred in almost all
     circumstances.  Unlike save, it makes the relocatable section
     permanent, and causes no future gc of currently loaded .o files.

 -- Function: HELP* (string &optional (package 'lisp))
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Prints the documentation associated with those
     symbols in the specified package whose print names contain STRING
     as substring.  STRING may be a symbol, in which case the print-name
     of that symbol is used.  If PACKAGE is NIL, then all packages are
     searched.

 -- Macro: DEFLA
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defla name lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)

     GCL specific: Used to DEFine Lisp Alternative.  For the
     interpreter, DEFLA is equivalent to DEFUN, but the compiler ignores
     this form.

 -- Function: PROCLAMATION (decl-spec)
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Returns T if the specified declaration is globally in
     effect; NIL otherwise.  See the doc of DECLARE for possible
     DECL-SPECs.

 -- Macro: DEFENTRY
     Package:LISP

     Syntax:
          (defentry name arg-types c-function)

     GCL specific: The compiler defines a Lisp function whose body
     consists of a calling sequence to the C language function specified
     by C-FUNCTION. The interpreter ignores this form.  The ARG-TYPES
     specifies the C types of the arguments which C-FUNCTION requires.
     The list of allowed types is (object char int float double string).
     Code will be produced to coerce from a lisp object to the
     appropriate type before passing the argument to the C-FUNCTION. The
     c-function should be of the form (c-result-type c-fname) where
     c-result-type is a member of (void object char int float double
     string).  c-fname may be a symbol (in which case it will be
     downcased) or a string.  If c-function is not a list, then (object
     c-function) is assumed.  In order for C code to be loaded in by
     ‘load’ you should declare any variables and functions to be static.
     If you will link them in at build time, of course you are allowed
     to define new externals.

            Sample usage:
          --File begin-----
          ;; JOE takes X a lisp string and Y a fixnum and returns a character.
          (clines "#include \"foo.ch\"")
          (defentry joe (string int) (char "our_c_fun"))
          ---File end------
          ---File foo.ch---
          /* C function for extracting the i'th element of a string */
          static char our_c_fun(p,i)
          char *p;
          int i;
             {
          	return p[i];
             }
          -----File end---

     One must be careful of storage allocation issues when passing a
     string.  If the C code invokes storage allocation (either by
     calling ‘malloc’ or ‘make_cons’ etc), then there is a possibility
     of a garbage collection, so that if the string passed was not
     constructed with ‘:static t’ when its array was constructed, then
     it could move.  If the C function may allocate storage, then you
     should pass a copy:
          (defun safe-c-string (x)
            (let* ((n (length x))
                   (a (make-array (+ n 1) :element-type 'string-char
                     :static t :fill-pointer n)))
              (si::copy-array-portion x y 0 0 n)
              (setf (aref a n) (code-char 0)))
              a)


 -- Function: COPY-ARRAY-PORTION (x,y,i1,i2,n1)
     Package:SI Copy elements from X to Y starting at X[i1] to Y[i2] and
     doing N1 elements if N1 is supplied otherwise, doing the length of
     X - I1 elements.  If the types of the arrays are not the same, this
     has implementation dependent results.

 -- Function: BYE ( &optional (exit-status 0))
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Exits from GCL with exit-status.

 -- Function: USE-FAST-LINKS (turn-on)
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: If TURN-ON is not nil, the fast link mechanism is
     enabled, so that ordinary function calls will not appear in the
     invocation stack, and calls will be much faster.  This is the
     default.  If you anticipate needing to see a stack trace in the
     debugger, then you should turn this off.

15.1 Bignums
============

A directory mp was added to hold the new multi precision arithmetic
code.  The layout and a fair amount of code in the mp directory is an
enhanced version of gpari version 34.  The gpari c code was rewritten to
be more efficient, and gcc assembler macros were added to allow inlining
of operations not possible to do in C. On a 68K machine, this allows the
C version to be as efficient as the very carefully written assembler in
the gpari distribution.  For the main machines, an assembler file
(produced by gcc) based on this new method, is included.  This is for
sites which do not have gcc, or do not wish to compile the whole system
with gcc.

   Bignum arithmetic is much faster now.  Many changes were made to
cmpnew also, to add 'integer' as a new type.  It differs from variables
of other types, in that storage is associated to each such variable, and
assignments mean copying the storage.  This allows a function which does
a good deal of bignum arithmetic, to do very little consing in the heap.
An example is the computation of PI-INV in scratchpad, which calculates
the inverse of pi to a prescribed number of bits accuracy.  That
function is now about 20 times faster, and no longer causes garbage
collection.  In versions of GCL where HAVE_ALLOCA is defined, the
temporary storage growth is on the C stack, although this often not so
critical (for example it makes virtually no difference in the PI-INV
example, since in spite of the many operations, only one storage
allocation takes place.

   Below is the actual code for PI-INV

   On a sun3/280 (cli.com)

   Here is the comparison of lucid and gcl before and after on that
pi-inv.  Times are in seconds with multiples of the gcl/akcl time in
parentheses.

16.1 Available Symbols
======================

When GCL is built, those symbols in the system libraries which are
referenced by functions linked in in the list of objects given in
‘unixport/makefile’, become available for reference by GCL code.

   On some systems it is possible with ‘faslink’ to load ‘.o’ files
which reference other libraries, but in general this practice is not
portable.

16.2 External Shared Libraries
==============================

 -- Macro: DEFDLFUN
     Package:SYSTEM

     Syntax:
          (compile (DEFDLFUN {RETURN NAME &optional LIBNAME) ARGS*))

     GCL specific: Produces an entry function to function NAME in
     external shared library LIBNAME with the specified args/return
     signature.  This function must be compiled to run.  When inlined,
     the function call collapses to a single reference to a pointer
     which is automatically updated to the location of the external
     function at image startup.  The connection to the external library
     is persistent across image saves and re-executions.  The RETURN and
     ARGS specifiers are keywords from the following list corresponding
     to the accompanying C programming types:

     :char :short :int :long :float :double

     Unsigned versions available are:

     :uchar :ushort :uint

     Complex float and complex double types can be access via:

     :fcomplex :dcomples

     Pointers to types available are

     :void* :char* :long* :float* :double*

     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Open a socket connection to HOST at PORT.

 -- Function: OPEN-NAMED-SOCKET (port)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Open a socket on PORT, returning (cons fd portname)
     where fd is a small fixnum which is the write file descriptor for
     the socket.  If PORT is zero do automatic allocation of port.

 -- Function: ACCEPT-SOCKET-CONNECTION (NAMED_SOCKET)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Wait for a connection on NAMED_SOCKET and return
     (list* named_socket fd name1) when one is established.

 -- Function: ALLOCATE-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES (number &optional
          (really-allocate nil))
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Sets the maximum number of pages for contiguous
     blocks to NUMBER. If REALLY-ALLOCATE is non-NIL, then the specified
     number of pages will be allocated immediately.

 -- Function: FREEZE-DEFSTRUCT (name)
     Package:SI

     The inline defstruct type checker will be made more efficient, in
     that it will only check for types which currently include NAME.
     After calling this the defstruct should not be altered.

 -- Function: MAXIMUM-ALLOCATABLE-PAGES (type)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the current maximum number of pages for the
     type class of the GCL implementation type TYPE.

     evaluation of the FORM has successfully completed, SI:ERROR-SET
     returns NIL as the first value and the result of the evaluation as
     the rest of the values.  If, in the course of the evaluation, a
     non-local jump from the FORM is atempted, SI:ERROR-SET traps the
     jump and returns the corresponding jump tag as its value.

 -- Function: COMPILED-FUNCTION-NAME (compiled-function-object)

 -- Function: UNIVERSAL-ERROR-HANDLER (error-name correctable
          function-name continue-format-string error-format-string &rest
          args)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Starts the error handler of GCL. When an error is
     detected, GCL calls SI:UNIVERSAL-ERROR-HANDLER with the specified
     arguments.  ERROR-NAME is the name of the error.  CORRECTABLE is T
     for a correctable error and NIL for a fatal error.  FUNCTION-NAME
     is the name of the function that caused the error.
     CONTINUE-FORMAT-STRING and ERROR-FORMAT-STRING are the format
     strings of the error message.  ARGS are the arguments to the format
     strings.  To change the error handler of GCL, redefine
     SI:UNIVERSAL-ERROR- HANDLER.

 -- Variable: *CODE-BLOCK-RESERVE*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Set this variable to a static array
     (supply :static t to 'make-array) to reserve space for loading code
     in low memory as the heap grows large.  On large systems, it may
     prove impossible without this to find unallocated memory below, for
     example, the 2Gb limit required for the default 'medium model' code
     produced by gcc on x86_64 systems.

 -- Variable: *FAST-LINK-WARNINGS*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to trace function calls
     that cannot proceed through a simple pointer dereference, usually
     because the signature of the callee is substantially different than
     that assumed when compiling the caller.

 -- Variable: *ANNOTATE*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add comments in
     the generated C code indicating lisp function inlining.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-PROF-P*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add the :prof t
     option to compile file by default to indicate code which should be
     prepared for gprof profiling.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-LARGE-MEMORY-MODEL-P*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add the
     :large-memory-model t option to compile file by default to instruct
     gcc to produce code that can be loaded at any address, typically at
     a 10% performance penalty.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-C-FILE*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add the :c-file t
     option to compile file by default to keep the intermediate
     generated C file.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-H-FILE*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add the :h-file t
     option to compile file by default to keep the intermediate
     generated header file.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-DATA-FILE*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add the :data-file
     t option to compile file by default to keep the intermediate
     generated data file.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-SYSTEM-P*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to add the :system-p
     t option to compile file by default to write a reference to the
     system cmpinclude.h file in the generated C code as opposed to
     inserting its contents in the file directly.

 -- Variable: *FASD-DATA*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to NIL to write the data file in
     human readable format.

 -- Variable: *KEEP-GAZ*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Set to non-NIL to preserve anonymous
     "gazonk" .o files.

 -- Variable: *DISASSEMBLE-OBJDUMP*
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: When set to non-NIL, 'disassemble
     will report assembly instructions output by objdump in addition to
     the C code output by GCL.

 -- Function: FILE
     Package:SI GCL specific: Return the source file from which the
     designated function was loaded.

 -- Function: SIGNATURE
     Package:SI GCL specific: Return the call signature of the
     designated function.

 -- Function: INTERPRET
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: Just as (compile 'foo) will replace
     an interpreted function designated by 'foo with a compiled one,
     (compiler::interpret 'foo) will do the reverse.  Both functions are
     idempotent operations.

 -- Function: WATCH
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: (watch 'foo) will trace compiler
     logic pertaining to 'foo.  (watch 'compiler::tail-recursion) will
     trace the compiler's treatment of tail recursion optimization.
     Other useful options include 'compiler::type-inference,
     'compiler::branch-elimination, and 'compiler::inline.

 -- Function: UNWATCH
     Package:COMPILER GCL specific: (unwatch 'foo) will stop tracing
     'foo.  (unwatch) will stop all compiler tracing.

 -- Variable: *INTERRUPT-ENABLE*
     Package:SI GCL specific: If the value of SI:*INTERRUPT-ENABLE* is
     non-NIL, GCL signals an error on the terminal interrupt (this is
     the default case).  If it is NIL, GCL ignores the interrupt and
     assigns T to SI:*INTERRUPT-ENABLE*.

 -- Function: CHDIR (pathname)
     Package:SI

     GCL/UNIX specific: Changes the current working directory to the
     specified pathname.

 -- Function: COPY-STREAM (in-stream out-stream)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Copies IN-STREAM to OUT-STREAM until the end-of-file
     on IN- STREAM.

 -- Function: INIT-SYSTEM ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Initializes the library and the compiler of GCL.
     Since they have already been initialized in the standard image of
     GCL, calling SI:INIT- SYSTEM will cause an error.

 -- Variable: *INDENT-FORMATTED-OUTPUT*
     Package:SI GCL specific: The FORMAT directive ~% indents the next
     line if the value of this variable is non-NIL. If NIL, ~% simply
     does Newline.

 -- Function: SET-HOLE-SIZE (fixnum)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Sets the size of the memory hole (in pages).

 -- Function: FRS-BDS (i)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the bind stack index of the i-th entity in
     the frame stack.

 -- Function: IHS-FUN (i)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the function value of the i-th entity in the
     invocation history stack.

 -- Function: *MAKE-CONSTANT (symbol value)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Makes the SYMBOL a constant with the specified VALUE.

 -- Function: FIXNUMP (object)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns T if the OBJECT is a fixnum; NIL otherwise.

 -- Function: BDS-VAL (i)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the value of the i-th entity in the bind
     stack.

 -- Function: STRING-TO-OBJECT (string)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: (SI:STRING-TO-OBJECT STRING) is equivalent to
     (READ-FROM-STRING STRING), but much faster.

 -- Variable: *SYSTEM-DIRECTORY*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Holds the name of the system directory of
     GCL.

 -- Function: FRS-IHS (i)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the invocation history stack index of the
     i-th entity in the frame stack.

 -- Function: RESET-GBC-COUNT ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Resets the counter of the garbage collector that
     records how many times the garbage collector has been called for
     each implementation type.

 -- Function: CATCH-BAD-SIGNALS ()
     Package:SI

     GCL/BSD specific: Installs a signal catcher for bad signals:
     SIGILL, SIGIOT, SIGEMT, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, SIGSYS. The signal
     catcher, upon catching the signal, signals an error (and enter the
     break-level).  Since the internal memory of GCL may be broken, the
     user should check the signal and exit from GCL if necessary.  When
     the signal is caught during garbage collection, GCL terminates
     immediately.

 -- Function: RESET-STACK-LIMITS ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Resets the stack limits to the normal state.  When a
     stack has overflowed, GCL extends the limit for the stack in order
     to execute the error handler.  After processing the error, GCL
     resets the stack limit by calling SI:RESET-STACK-LIMITS.

 -- Variable: *GBC-MESSAGE*
     Package:SI GCL specific: If the value of SI:*GBC-MESSAGE* is
     non-NIL, the garbage collector prints some information on the
     terminal.  Usually SI:*GBC-MESSAGE* should be set NIL.

 -- Variable: *GBC-NOTIFY*
     Package:SI GCL specific: If the value is non-NIL, the garbage
     collector prints a very brief one line message about the area
     causing the collection, and the time spent in internal time units.

 -- Variable: *AFTER-GBC-HOOK*
     Package:SI Defaults to nil, but may be set to a function of one
     argument TYPE which is a lisp variable indicating the TYPE which
     caused the current collection.

 -- Funcition: ALLOCATED (type)
     Package:SI

     Returns 6 values:
     nfree
          number free
     npages
          number of pages
     maxpage
          number of pages to grow to
     nppage
          number per page
     gbccount
          number of gc's due to running out of items of this size
     nused
          number of items used

     Note that all items of the same size are stored on similar pages.
     Thus for example on a 486 under linux the following basic types are
     all the same size and so will share the same allocated information:
     CONS BIGNUM RATIO COMPLEX STRUCTURE.

 -- Function: *MAKE-SPECIAL (symbol)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Makes the SYMBOL globally special.

 -- Function: MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM-FROM-STRING (string)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Creates a string-output-stream corresponding to the
     STRING and returns it.  The STRING should have a fill-pointer.

 -- Variable: *IGNORE-EOF-ON-TERMINAL-IO*
     Package:SI GCL specific: If the value of
     SI:*IGNORE-EOF-ON-TERMINAL-IO* is non-NIL, GCL ignores the
     eof-character (usually ^D) on the terminal and the terminal never
     becomes end-of-file.  The default value of
     SI:*IGNORE-EOF-ON-TERMINAL-IO* is NIL.

 -- Function: ADDRESS (object)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the address of the OBJECT as a fixnum.  The
     address of an object depends on the version of GCL. E.g.
     (SI:ADDRESS NIL) returns 1879062044 on GCL/AOSVS dated March 14,
     1986.

 -- Variable: *LISP-MAXPAGES*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Holds the maximum number of pages (1 page
     = 2048 bytes) for the GCL process.  The result of changing the
     value of SI:*LISP-MAXPAGES* is unpredictable.

 -- Function: ARGC ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the number of arguments on the command line
     that invoked the GCL process.

 -- Function: NANI (fixnum)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the object in the address FIXNUM. This
     function is the inverse of SI:ADDRESS. Although SI:ADDRESS is a
     harmless operation, SI:NANI is quite dangerous and should be used
     with care.

 -- Variable: *NOTIFY-GBC*
     Package:SI GCL specific: If the value of this variable is non-NIL,
     then the garbage collector notifies that it begins to run whenever
     it is invoked.  Otherwise, garbage collection begins silently.

 -- Function: SAVE-SYSTEM (pathname)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Saves the current GCL core imange into a program file
     specified by PATHNAME. This function differs from SAVE in that the
     contiguous and relocatable areas are made permanent in the saved
     image.  Usually the standard image of GCL interpreter/compiler is
     saved by SI:SAVE-SYSTEM. This function causes an exit from lisp.
     Various changes are made to the memory of the running system, such
     as closing files and resetting io streams.  It would not be
     possible to continue normally.

 -- Function: UNCATCH-BAD-SIGNALS ()
     Package:SI

     GCL/BSD specific: Undoes the effect of SI:CATCH-BAD-SIGNALS.

 -- Function: VS (i)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the i-th entity in the value stack.

 -- Function: DISPLACED-ARRAY-P (array)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns T if the ARRAY is a displaced array; NIL
     otherwise.

 -- Function: ARGV (fixnum)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the FIXNUM-th argument on the command line
     that invoked the GCL process.

 -- Variable: *DEFAULT-TIME-ZONE*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Holds the default time zone.  The initial
     value of SI:*DEFAULT- TIME-ZONE* is 6 (the time zone of Austin,
     Texas).

 -- Function: GETENV (string)
     Package:SI

     GCL/UNIX specific: Returns the environment with the name STRING as
     a string; if the environment specified by STRING is not found,
     returns NIL.

 -- Function: FASLINK (file string)
     Package:SI

     GCL/BSD specific: Loads the FASL file FILE while linking the object
     files and libraries specified by STRING. For example, (faslink
     "foo.o" "bar.o boo.o -lpixrect") loads foo.o while linking two
     object files (bar.o and boo.o) and the library pixrect.  Usually,
     foo.o consists of the C language interface for the functions
     defined in the object files or the libraries.

     A more portable way of making references to C code, is to build it
     in at the time of the original make.  If foo.c references things in
     -lpixrect, and foo.o is its compilation in the gcl/unixport
     directory

     (cd gcl/unixport ; make "EXTRAS= foo.o -lpixrect ")

     should add them.  If EXTRAS was already joe.o in the
     unixport/makefile you should of course add joe.o to the above
     "EXTRAS= joe.o foo.o.."

     Faslink does not work on most UNIX systems which are derived from
     SYS V or AIX.

 -- Function: TOP-LEVEL ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Starts the standard top-level listener of GCL. When
     the GCL process is invoked, it calls SI:TOP-LEVEL by (FUNCALL
     'SI:TOP-LEVEL). To change the top-level of GCL, redefine
     SI:TOP-LEVEL and save the core imange in a file.  When the saved
     imange is invoked, it will start the redefined top-level.

 -- Function: FRS-VS (i)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the value stack index of the i-th entity in
     the frame stack.

 -- Function: WRITE-DEBUG-SYMBOLS (start file &key (main-file
          "/usr/local/schelter/xgcl/unixport/raw_gcl") (output-file
          "debug-symbols.o" ))
     Package:SI

     Write out a file of debug-symbols using address START as the place
     where FILE will be loaded into the running executable MAIN-FILE.
     The last is a keyword argument.

 -- Function: PROF (x y)
     Package:SI

     These functions in the SI package are GCL specific, and allow
     monitoring the run time of functions loaded into GCL, as well as
     the basic functions.  Sample Usage: (si::set-up-profile 1000000)
     (si::prof 0 90) run program (si::prof 0 0) ;; turn off profile
     (si::display-prof) (si::clear-profile) (si::prof 0 90) ;; start
     profile again run program ..  Profile can be stopped with (si::prof
     0 0) and restarted with (si::prof 0 90) The START-ADDRESS will
     correspond to the beginning of the profile array, and the SCALE
     will mean that 256 bytes of code correspond to SCALE bytes in the
     profile array.

     Thus if the profile array is 1,000,000 bytes long and the code
     segment is 5 megabytes long you can profile the whole thing using a
     scale of 50 Note that long runs may result in overflow, and so an
     understating of the time in a function.

     You must run intensively however since, with a scale of 128 it
     takes 6,000,000 times through a loop to overflow the sampling in
     one part of the code.

 -- Function: CATCH-FATAL (i)
     Package:SI

     Sets the value of the C variable catch_fatal to I which should be
     an integer.  If catch_fatal is 1, then most unrecoverable fatal
     errors will be caught.  Upon catching such an error catch_fatal
     becomes -1, to avoid recursive errors.  The top level loop
     automatically sets catch_fatal to 1, if the value is less than
     zero.  Catching can be turned off by making catch_fatal = 0.

 -- Variable: *MULTIPLY-STACKS*
     Package:SI

     If this variable is set to a positive fixnum, then the next time
     through the TOP-LEVEL loop, the loop will be exited.  The size of
     the stacks will be multiplied by the value of *multiply-stacks*,
     and the TOP-LEVEL will be called again.  Thus to double the size of
     the stacks:

     >(setq si::*multiply-stacks* 2) [exits top level and reinvokes it,
     with the new stacks in place] >

     We must exit TOP-LEVEL, because it and any other lisp functions
     maintain many pointers into the stacks, which would be incorrect
     when the stacks have been moved.  Interrupting the process of
     growing the stacks, can leave you in an inconsistent state.

 -- Function: GBC-TIME (&optional x)
     Package:SI

     Sets the internal C variable gc_time to X if X is supplied and then
     returns gc_time.  If gc_time is greater or equal to 0, then gc_time
     is incremented by the garbage collector, according to the number of
     internal time units spent there.  The initial value of gc_time is
     -1.

 -- Function: FWRITE (string start count stream)
     Package:SI

     Write from STRING starting at char START (or 0 if it is nil) COUNT
     characters (or to end if COUNT is nil) to STREAM. STREAM must be a
     stream such as returned by FP-OUTPUT-STREAM. Returns nil if it
     fails.

 -- Function: FREAD (string start count stream)
     Package:SI

     Read characters into STRING starting at char START (or 0 if it is
     nil) COUNT characters (or from start to length of STRING if COUNT
     is nil).  Characters are read from STREAM. STREAM must be a stream
     such as returned by FP-INPUT-STREAM. Returns nil if it fails.
     Return number of characters read if it succeeds.

 -- Function: SGC-ON (&optional ON)
     Package:SI

     If ON is not nil then SGC (stratified garbage collection) is turned
     on.  If ON is supplied and is nil, then SGC is turned off.  If ON
     is not supplied, then it returns T if SGC is on, and NIL if SGC is
     off.

     The purpose of SGC is to prevent paging activity during garbage
     collection.  It is efficient if the actual number of pages being
     written to form a small percentage of the total image size.  The
     image should be built as compactly as possible.  This can be
     accomplished by using a settings such as (si::allocate-growth 'cons
     1 10 50 20) to limit the growth in the cons maxpage to 10 pages per
     time.  Then just before calling si::save-system to save your image
     you can do something like:

     (si::set-hole-size 500)(gbc nil) (si::sgc-on t) (si::save-system
     ..)

     This makes the saved image come up with SGC on.  We have set a
     reasonably large hole size.  This is so that allocation of pages
     either because they fill up, or through specific calls to
     si::allocate, will not need to move all the relocatable data.
     Moving relocatable data requires turning SGC off, performing a full
     gc, and then turning it back on.  New relocatable data is collected
     by SGC, but moving the old requires going through all pages of
     memory to change pointers into it.

     Using si::*notify-gbc* gives information about the number of pages
     used by SGC.

     Note that SGC is only available on operating systems which provide
     the mprotect system call, to write protect pages.  Otherwise we
     cannot tell which pages have been written too.

 -- Function: ALLOCATE-SGC (type min-pages max-pages percent-free)
     Package:SI

     If MIN-PAGES is 0, then this type will not be swept by SGC.
     Otherwise this is the minimum number of pages to make available to
     SGC. MAX-PAGES is the upper limit of such pages.  Only pages with
     PERCENT-FREE objects on them, will be assigned to SGC. A list of
     the previous values for min, max and percent are returned.

 -- Function: ALLOCATE-GROWTH (type min max percent percent-free)
     Package:SI

     The next time after a garbage collection for TYPE, if PERCENT-FREE
     of the objects of this TYPE are not actually free, and if the
     maximum number of pages for this type has already been allocated,
     then the maximum number will be increased by PERCENT of the old
     maximum, subject to the condition that this increment be at least
     MIN pages and at most MAX pages.  A list of the previous values for
     min, max, percent, and percent-free for the type TYPE is returned.
     A value of 0 means use the system default, and if an argument is
     out of range then the current values are returned with no change
     made.

     Examples: (si::allocate-growth 'cons 1 10 50 10) would insist that
     after a garbage collection for cons, there be at least 10% cons's
     free.  If not the number of cons pages would be grown by 50% or 10
     pages which ever was smaller.  This might be reasonable if you were
     trying to build an image which was 'full', ie had few free objects
     of this type.

     (si::allocate-growth 'fixnum 0 10000 30 40) would grow space till
     there were normally 40% free fixnums, usually growing by 30% per
     time.

     (si::allocate-growth 'cons 0 0 0 40) would require 40% free conses
     after garbage collection for conses, and would use system defaults
     for the the rate to grow towards this goal.

     (si::allocate-growth 'cons -1 0 0 0) would return the current
     values, but not make any changes.

 -- Function: OPEN-FASD (stream direction eof-value table)
     Package:SI

     Given file STREAM open for input or output in DIRECTION, set it up
     to start writing or reading in fasd format.  When reading from this
     stream the EOF-VALUE will be returned when the end a fasd end of
     dump marker is encountered.  TABLE should be an eq hashtable on
     output, a vector on input, or nil.  In this last case a default one
     will be constructed.

     We shall refer to the result as a 'fasd stream'.  It is suitable as
     the arg to CLOSE-FASD, READ-FASD-TOP, and as the second second arg
     to WRITE-FASD. As a lisp object it is actually a vector, whose body
     coincides with:

     struct fasd { object stream; /* lisp object of type stream */
     object table; /* hash table used in dumping or vector on input*/
     object eof; /* lisp object to be returned on coming to eof mark */
     object direction; /* holds Cnil or Kinput or Koutput */ object
     package; /* the package symbols are in by default */ object index;
     /* integer.  The current_dump index on write */ object filepos; /*
     nil or the position of the start */ object table_length; /* On read
     it is set to the size dump array needed or 0 */ object macro ; }

     We did not use a defstruct for this, because we want the compiler
     to use this and it makes bootstrapping more difficult.  It is in
     "cmpnew/fasdmacros.lsp"

 -- Function: WRITE-FASD-TOP (X FASD-STREAM)
     Package:SI

     Write X to FASD-STREAM.

 -- Function: READ-FASD-TOP (FASD-STREAM)
     Package:SI

     Read the next object from FASD-STREAM. Return the eof-value of
     FASD-STREAM if we encounter an eof marker put out by CLOSE-FASD.
     Encountering end of actual file stream causes an error.

 -- Function: CLOSE-FASD (FASD-STREAM)
     Package:SI

     On output write an eof marker to the associated file stream, and
     then make FASD-STREAM invalid for further output.  It also attempts
     to write information to the stream on the size of the index table
     needed to read from the stream from the last open.  This is useful
     in growing the array.  It does not alter the file stream, other
     than for writing this information to it.  The file stream may be
     reopened for further use.  It is an error to OPEN-FASD the same
     file or file stream again with out first calling CLOSE-FASD.

 -- Function: FIND-SHARING-TOP (x table)
     Package:SI

     X is any lisp object and TABLE is an eq hash table.  This walks
     through X making entries to indicate the frequency of
     symbols,lists, and arrays.  Initially items get -1 when they are
     first met, and this is decremented by 1 each time the object
     occurs.  Call this function on all the objects in a fasd file,
     which you wish to share structure.

 -- Variable: *LOAD-PATHNAME*
     Package:SI Load binds this to the pathname of the file being
     loaded.

 -- Macro: DEFINE-INLINE-FUNCTION (fname vars &body body)
     Package:SI

     This is equivalent to defun except that VARS may not contain
     &optional, &rest, &key or &aux.  Also a compiler property is added,
     which essentially saves the body and turns this into a let of the
     VARS and then execution of the body.  This last is done using
     si::DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO Example: (si::define-inline-function
     myplus (a b c) (+ a b c))

 -- Macro: DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO (fname vars &body body)
     Package:SI

     FNAME may be the name of a function, but at compile time the macro
     expansion given by this is used.

     (si::define-compiler-macro mycar (a) '(car ,a))

 -- Function: DBL ()
     Package:SI

     Invoke a top level loop, in which debug commands may be entered.
     These commands may also be entered at breaks, or in the error
     handler.  See SOURCE-LEVEL-DEBUG

 -- Function: NLOAD (file)
     Package:SI

     Load a file with the readtable bound to a special readtable, which
     permits tracking of source line information as the file is loaded.
     see SOURCE-LEVEL-DEBUG

 -- Function: BREAK-FUNCTION (function &optional line absolute)
     Package:SI

     Set a breakpoint for a FUNCTION at LINE if the function has source
     information loaded.  If ABSOLUTE is not nil, then the line is
     understood to be relative to the beginning of the buffer.  See also
     dbl-break-function, the emacs command.

 -- Function: XDR-OPEN (stream)
     Package:SI

     Returns an object suitable for passing to XDR-READ if the stream is
     an input stream, and XDR-WRITE if it was an output stream.  Note
     the stream must be a unix stream, on which si::fp-input-stream or
     si::fp-output-stream would act as the identity.

 -- Function: FP-INPUT-STREAM (stream)
     Package:SI

     Return a unix stream for input associated to STREAM if possible,
     otherwise return nil.

 -- Function: FP-OUTPUT-STREAM (stream)
     Package:SI

     Return a unix stream for output associated to STREAM if possible,
     otherwise return nil.

 -- Function: XDR-READ (stream element)
     Package:SI

     Read one item from STREAM of type the type of ELEMENT. The
     representation of the elements is machine independent.  The xdr
     routines are what is used by the basic unix rpc calls.

 -- Function: XDR-WRITE (stream element)
     Package:SI

     Write to STREAM the given ELEMENT.

 -- Variable: *TOP-LEVEL-HOOK*
     Package:SI If this variable is has a function as its value at start
     up time, then it is run immediately after the init.lsp file is
     loaded.  This is useful for starting up an alternate top level
     loop.

 -- Function: RUN-PROCESS (string arglist)
     Package:SI

     Execute the command STRING in a subshell passing the strings in the
     list ARGLIST as arguments to the command.  Return a two way stream
     associated to this.  Use si::fp-output-stream to get an associated
     output stream or si::fp-input-stream.

     Bugs: It does not properly deallocate everything, so that it will
     fail if you call it too many times.

 -- Variable: *CASE-FOLD-SEARCH*
     Package: SI Non nil means that a string-match should ignore case

 -- Function: STRING-MATCH (pattern string &optional start end)
     Package: SI Match regexp PATTERN in STRING starting in string
     starting at START and ending at END. Return -1 if match not found,
     otherwise return the start index of the first matches.  The
     variable *MATCH-DATA* will be set to a fixnum array of sufficient
     size to hold the matches, to be obtained with match-beginning and
     match-end.  If it already contains such an array, then the contents
     of it will be over written.

     The form of a regexp pattern is discussed in *Note Regular
     Expressions::.

 -- Function: MATCH-BEGINNING (index)
     Returns the beginning of the I'th match from the previous
     STRING-MATCH, where the 0th is for the whole regexp and the
     subsequent ones match parenthetical expressions.  -1 is returned if
     there is no match, or if the *match-data* vector is not a fixnum
     array.

 -- Function: MATCH-END (index)
     Returns the end of the I'th match from the previous STRING-MATCH

 -- Function: SOCKET (port &key host server async myaddr myport daemon)

     Establishes a socket connection to the specified PORT under a
     variety of circumstances.

     If HOST is specified, then it is a string designating the IP
     address of the server to which we are the client.  ASYNC specifies
     that the connection should be made asynchronously, and the call
     return immediately.  MYADDR and MYPORT can specify the IP address
     and port respectively of a client connection, for example when the
     running machine has several network interfaces.

     If SERVER is specified, then it is a function which will handle
     incoming connections to this PORT. DAEMON specifies that the
     running process should be forked to handle incoming connections in
     the background.  If DAEMON is set to the keyword PERSISTENT, then
     the backgrounded process will survive when the parent process
     exits, and the SOCKET call returns NIL. Any other non-NIL setting
     of DAEMON causes the socket call to return the process id of the
     backgrounded process.  DAEMON currently only works on BSD and Linux
     based systems.

     If DAEMON is not set or nil, or if the socket is not a SERVER
     socket, then the SOCKET call returns a two way stream.  In this
     case, the running process is responsible for all I/O operations on
     the stream.  Specifically, if a SERVER socket is created as a
     non-DAEMON, then the running process must LISTEN for connections,
     ACCEPT them when present, and call the SERVER function on the
     stream returned by ACCEPT.

 -- Function: ACCEPT (stream)

     Creates a new two-way stream to handle an individual incoming
     connection to STREAM, which must have been created with the SOCKET
     function with the SERVER keyword set.  ACCEPT should only be
     invoked when LISTEN on STREAM returns T. If the STREAM was created
     with the DAEMON keyword set in the call to SOCKET, ACCEPT is
     unnecessary and will be called automatically as needed.

17.1 Regular Expressions
========================

The function ‘string-match’ (*Index string-match::) is used to match a
regular expression against a string.  If the variable
‘*case-fold-search*’ is not nil, case is ignored in the match.  To
determine the extent of the match use *Index match-beginning:: and
*Index match-end::.

   Regular expressions are implemented using Henry Spencer's package
(thank you Henry!), and much of the description of regular expressions
below is copied verbatim from his manual entry.  Code for delimited
searches, case insensitive searches, and speedups to allow fast
searching of long files was contributed by W. Schelter.  The speedups
use an adaptation by Schelter of the Boyer and Moore string search
algorithm to the case of branched regular expressions.  These allow such
expressions as 'not_there|really_not' to be searched for 30 times faster
than in GNU emacs (1995), and 200 times faster than in the original
Spencer method.  Expressions such as [a-u]bcdex get a speedup of 60 and
194 times respectively.  This is based on searching a string of 50000
characters (such as the file tk.lisp).

   • A regular expression is a string containing zero or more branches
     which are separated by ‘|’.  A match of the regular expression
     against a string is simply a match of the string with one of the
     branches.
   • Each branch consists of zero or more pieces, concatenated.  A
     matching string must contain an initial substring matching the
     first piece, immediately followed by a second substring matching
     the second piece and so on.
   • Each piece is an atom optionally followed by ‘+’, ‘*’, or ‘?’.
   • An atom followed by ‘+’ matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of
     the atom.
   • An atom followed by ‘*’ matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of
     the atom.
   • An atom followed by ‘?’ matches a match of the atom, or the null
     string.
   • An atom is
        − a regular expression in parentheses matching a match for the
          regular expression
        − a range see below
        − a ‘.’ matching any single character
        − a ‘^’ matching the null string at the beginning of the input
          string
        − a ‘$’ matching the null string at the end of the input string
        − a ‘\’ followed by a single character matching that character
        − a single character with no other significance (matching that
          character).
   • A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in ‘[]’.  It normally
     matches any single character from the sequence.
        − If the sequence begins with ‘^’, it matches any single
          character not from the rest of the sequence.
        − If two characters in the sequence are separated by ‘-’, this
          is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between
          them (e.g.  ‘[0-9]’ matches any decimal digit).
        − To include a literal ‘]’ in the sequence, make it the first
          character (following a possible ‘^’).
        − To include a literal ‘-’, make it the first or last character.

Ordering Multiple Matches
-------------------------

In general there may be more than one way to match a regular expression
to an input string.  For example, consider the command

      (string-match "(a*)b*"  "aabaaabb")

   Considering only the rules given so far, the value of (list-matches 0
1) might be ‘("aabb" "aa")’ or ‘("aaab" "aaa")’ or ‘("ab" "a")’ or any
of several other combinations.  To resolve this potential ambiguity
string-match chooses among alternatives using the rule first then
longest.  In other words, it considers the possible matches in order
working from left to right across the input string and the pattern, and
it attempts to match longer pieces of the input string before shorter
ones.  More specifically, the following rules apply in decreasing order
of priority:
     [1] If a regular expression could match two different parts of an
     input string then it will match the one that begins earliest.
     [2] If a regular expression contains | operators then the leftmost
     matching sub-expression is chosen.
     [3] In *, +, and ?  constructs, longer matches are chosen in
     preference to shorter ones.
     [4] In sequences of expression components the components are
     considered from left to right.

   In the example from above, (a*)b* matches aab: the (a*) portion of
the pattern is matched first and it consumes the leading aa; then the b*
portion of the pattern consumes the next b.  Or, consider the following
example:

      (string-match "(ab|a)(b*)c"  "xabc") ==> 1
      (list-matches 0 1 2 3) ==> ("abc" "ab" "" NIL)
      (match-beginning 0) ==> 1
      (match-end 0) ==> 4
      (match-beginning 1) ==> 1
      (match-end 1) ==> 3
      (match-beginning 2) ==> 3
      (match-end 2) ==> 3
      (match-beginning 3) ==> -1
      (match-end 3) ==> -1


   In the above example the return value of ‘1’ (which is ‘> -1’)
indicates that a match was found.  The entire match runs from 1 to 4.
Rule 4 specifies that (ab|a) gets first shot at the input string and
Rule 2 specifies that the ab sub-expression is checked before the a
sub-expression.  Thus the b has already been claimed before the (b*)
component is checked and (b*) must match an empty string.

   The special characters in the string ‘"\()[]+.*|^$?"’, must be
quoted, if a simple string search is desired.  The function
re-quote-string is provided for this purpose.
     (re-quote-string "*standard*") ==> "\\*standard\\*"

     (string-match (re-quote-string "*standard*") "X *standard* ")
      ==> 2

     (string-match "*standard*" "X *standard* ")
     Error: Regexp Error: ?+* follows nothing
   Note there is actually just one ‘\’ before the ‘*’ but the printer
makes two so that the string can be read, since ‘\’ is also the lisp
quote character.  In the last example an error is signalled since the
special character ‘*’ must follow an atom if it is interpreted as a
regular expression.

18.1 Source Level Debugging in Emacs
====================================

In emacs load (load "dbl.el") from the gcl/doc directory.  [ It also
requires gcl.el from that directory.  Your system administrator should
do make in the doc directory, so that these files are copied to the
standard location.]

   OVERVIEW:

   Lisp files loaded with si::nload will have source line information
about them recorded.  Break points may be set, and functions stepped.
Source code will be automatically displayed in the other window, with a
little arrow beside the current line.  The backtrace (command :bt) will
show line information and you will get automatic display of the source
as you move up and down the stack.

   FUNCTIONS: break points which have been set.  si::nload (file) load a
lisp file collecting source line information.

   si::break-function (function &optional line absolute) set up a
breakpoint for FUNCTION at LINE relative to start or ABSOLUTE

   EMACS COMMANDS: M-x dbl makes a dbl buffer, suitable for running an
inferior gcl.  It has special keybindings for stepping and viewing
sources.  You may start your favorite gcl program in the dbl shell
buffer.

   Inferior Dbl Mode: Major mode for interacting with an inferior Dbl
process.  The following commands are available:

   C-c l dbl-find-line

   ESC d dbl-:down ESC u dbl-:up ESC c dbl-:r ESC n dbl-:next ESC i
dbl-:step ESC s dbl-:step

   M-x dbl-display-frame displays in the other window the last line
referred to in the dbl buffer.

   ESC i and ESC n in the dbl window, call dbl to step and next and then
update the other window with the current file and position.

   If you are in a source file, you may select a point to break at, by
doing C-x SPC.

   Commands: Many commands are inherited from shell mode.  Additionally
we have:

   M-x dbl-display-frame display frames file in other window ESC i
advance one line in program ESC n advance one line in program (skip over
calls).  M-x send-dbl-command used for special printing of an arg at the
current point.  C-x SPACE sets break point at current line.

   -------------------

   When visiting a lisp buffer (if gcl.el is loaded in your emacs) the
command c-m-x evaluates the current defun into the process running in
the other window.  Line information will be kept.  This line information
allows you to set break points at a given line (by typing C-x \space on
the line in the source file where you want the break to occur.  Once
stopped within a function you may single step with M-s.  This moves one
line at a time in the source code, displaying a little arrow beside your
current position.  M-c is like M-s, except that function invocations are
skipped over, rather than entered into.  M-c continues execution.

   Keywords typed at top level, in the debug loop have a special
meaning:

     :delete [n1] [n2] ..  - delete all break points or just n1,n2
     :disable [n1] [n2] ..  - disable all break points or just n1,n2
     :enable [n1] [n2] ..  - enable all break points or just n1,n2
     :info [:bkpt] -print information about
     :break [fun] [line] - break at the current location, or if fun is
     supplied in fun.  Break at the beginning unless a line offset from
     the beginning of fun is supplied.
     :fr [n] go to frame n When in frame n, if the frame is interpreted,
     typing the name of locals, will print their values.  If it is
     compiled you must use (si::loc j) to print 'locj'.  Autodisplay of
     the source will take place if it is interpreted and the line can be
     determined.
     :up [n] go up n frames from the current frame.
     :down [n] go down n frames
     :bt [n] back trace starting at the current frame and going to top
     level If n is specified show only n frames.
     :r If stopped in a function resume.  If at top level in the dbl
     loop, exit and resume an outer loop.
     :q quit the computation back to top level dbl loop.
     :step step to the next line with line information
     :next step to the next line with line information skipping over
     function invocations.

18.2 Low Level Debug Functions
==============================

Use the following functions to directly access GCL stacks.
     (SI:VS i)	Returns the i-th entity in VS.
     (SI:IHS-VS i)	Returns the VS index of the i-th entity in IHS.
     (SI:IHS-FUN i)	Returns the function of the i-th entity in IHS.
     (SI:FRS-VS i)	Returns the VS index of the i-th entity in FRS.
     (SI:FRS-BDS i)	Returns the BDS index of the i-th entity in FRS.
     (SI:FRS-IHS i)	Returns the IHS index of the i-th entity in FRS.
     (SI:BDS-VAR i)	Returns the symbol of the i-th entity in BDS.
     (SI:BDS-VAL i)	Returns the value of the i-th entity in BDS.

     (SI:SUPER-GO i tag)
     	Jumps to the specified tag established by the TAGBODY frame at
     	FRS[i].  Both arguments are evaluated.  If FRS[i] happens to be
     	a non-TAGBODY frame, then (THROW (SI:IHS-TAG i) (VALUES)) is
     	performed.

19.1 Environment
================

The environment in GCL which is passed to macroexpand and other
functions requesting an environment, should be a list of 3 lists.  The
first list looks like ((v1 val1) (v2 val2) ..)  where vi are variables
and vali are their values.  The second is a list of ((fname1 .  fbody1)
(fname2 .  fbody2) ...)  where fbody1 is either (macro lambda-list
lambda-body) or (lambda-list lambda-body) depending on whether this is a
macro or a function.  The third list contains tags and blocks.

19.2 Initialization
===================

If the file init.lsp exists in the current directory, it is loaded at
startup.  The first argument passed to the executable image should be
the system directory.  Normally this would be gcl/unixport.  This
directory is stored in the si::*system-directory* variable.  If the file
sys-init.lsp exists in the system directory, it is loaded before
init.lsp.  See also si::*TOP-LEVEL-HOOK*.


File: gcl-si.info,  Node: Low Level X Interface,  Prev: Inititialization,  Up: Miscellaneous

19.3 Low Level X Interface
==========================

A sample program for drawing things on X windows from lisp is included
in the file gcl/lsp/littleXlsp.lsp

   That routine invokes the corresponding C routines in XLIB. So in
order to use it you must 'faslink' in the X routines.  Directions are
given at the beginning of the lisp file, for either building them into
the image or using faslink.

   This program is also a good tutorial on invoking C from lisp.

   See also defentry and faslink.

20 Compiler Definitions
***********************

 -- Function: EMIT-FN (turn-on)
     Package:COMPILER

     If TURN-ON is t, the subsequent calls to COMPILE-FILE will cause
     compilation of foo.lisp to emit a foo.fn as well as foo.o.  The .fn
     file contains cross referencing information as well as information
     useful to the collection utilities in cmpnew/collectfn This latter
     file must be manually loaded to call emit-fn.

 -- Variable: *CMPINCLUDE-STRING*
     Package:COMPILER If it is a string it holds the text of the
     cmpinclude.h file appropriate for this version.  Otherwise the
     usual #include of *cmpinclude* will be used.  To disable this
     feature set *cmpinclude-string* to NIL in the init-form.

 -- Function: EMIT-FN (turn-on)
     Package:COMPILER

     If TURN-ON is t, then subsequent calls to compile-file on a file
     foo.lisp cause output of a file foo.fn.  This .fn file contains
     lisp structures describing the functions in foo.lisp.  Some tools
     for analyzing this data base are WHO-CALLS,
     LIST-UNDEFINED-FUNCTIONS, LIST-UNCALLED-FUNCTIONS, and
     MAKE-PROCLAIMS.

     Usage: (compiler::emit-fn t) (compile-file "foo1.lisp")
     (compile-file "foo2.lisp")

     This would create foo1.fn and foo2.fn.  These may be loaded using
     LOAD. Each time compile-file is called the data base is cleared.
     Immediately after the compilation, the data base consists of data
     from the compilation.  Thus if you wished to find functions called
     but not defined in the current file, you could do
     (list-undefined-functions), immediately following the compilation.
     If you have a large system, you would load all the .fn files before
     using the above tools.

 -- Function: MAKE-ALL-PROCLAIMS (&rest directories)
     Package:COMPILER

     For each D in DIRECTORIES all files in (directory D) are loaded.

     For example (make-all-proclaims "lsp/*.fn" "cmpnew/*.fn") would
     load any files in lsp/*.fn and cmpnew/*.fn.

     [See EMIT-FN for details on creation of .fn files]

     Then calculations on the newly loaded .fn files are made, to
     determine function proclamations.  If number of values of a
     function cannot be determined [for example because of a final
     funcall, or call of a function totally unknown at this time] then
     return type * is assigned.

     Finally a file sys-proclaim.lisp is written out.  This file
     contains function proclamations.

     (load "sys-proclaim.lisp") (compile-file "foo1.lisp") (compile-file
     "foo2.lisp")

 -- Function: MAKE-PROCLAIMS (&optional (stream *standard-output*))
     Package:COMPILER

     Write to STREAM the function proclaims from the current data base.
     Usually a number of .fn files are loaded prior to running this.
     See EMIT-FN for details on how to collect this.  Simply use LOAD to
     load in .fn files.

 -- Function: LIST-UNDEFINED-FUNCTIONS ()
     Package:COMPILER

     Return a list of all functions called but not defined, in the
     current data base (see EMIT-FN).

          Sample:
          (compiler::emit-fn t)
          (compile-file "foo1.lisp")
          (compiler::list-undefined-functions)
          or
          (mapcar 'load (directory "*.fn")) (compiler::list-undefined-functions)


 -- Function: COMPILER-DEFAULT-TYPE (pathname)
     Package:COMPILER

     Allows you to set the default file extension for compiler source
     files.  The argument can either be a pathname or a string.  For
     example, imagine you have two files, "foo.lisp" and "foo1.lsp" in
     your working directory.  (Note the different extensions.)  Then:


          >(compile-file "foo")

          The source file foo.lsp is not found.
          NIL

          >(compile-file "foo1")

          Compiling foo1.lsp.
          End of Pass 1.
          End of Pass 2.
          OPTIMIZE levels: Safety=0 (No runtime error checking), Space=0, Speed=3
          Finished compiling foo1.
          #p"foo1.o"

          >(compiler::COMPILER-default-TYPE "lisp")

          #p".lisp"

          >(compile-file "foo")

          Compiling foo.lisp.
          End of Pass 1.
          End of Pass 2.
          OPTIMIZE levels: Safety=0 (No runtime error checking), Space=0, Speed=3
          Finished compiling foo.
          #p"foo.o"

          >(compile-file "foo1")

          The source file foo1.lisp is not found.
          NIL

          >


 -- Function: COMPILER-RESET-TYPE ()
     Package:COMPILER

     Resets the default compiler input file extension to the GCL
     historical value of #".lsp".

 -- Variable: *CC*
     Package:COMPILER Has value a string which controls which C compiler
     is used by GCL. Usually this string is obtained from the
     machine.defs file, but may be reset by the user, to change
     compilers or add an include path.

 -- Variable: *SPLIT-FILES*
     Package:COMPILER This affects the behaviour of compile-file, and is
     useful for cases where the C compiler cannot handle large C files
     resulting from lisp compilation.  This scheme should allow
     arbitrarily long lisp files to be compiled.

     If the value [default NIL] is a positive integer, then the source
     file will be compiled into several object files whose names have
     0,1,2,..  prepended, and which will be loaded by the main object
     file.  File 0 will contain compilation of top level forms thru
     position *split-files* in the lisp source file, and file 1 the next
     forms, etc.  Thus a 180k file would probably result in three object
     files (plus the master object file of the same name) if
     *split-files* was set to 60000.  The package information will be
     inserted in each file.

 -- Variable: *COMPILE-ORDINARIES*
     Package:COMPILER If this has a non nil value [default = nil], then
     all top level forms will be compiled into machine instructions.
     Otherwise only defun's, defmacro's, and top level forms beginning
     with (progn 'compile ...)  will do so.

21 JAPI GUI Library Binding
***************************

Introduction::
==============

The JAPI GUI library is hosted on the internet at:

       http://www.japi.de

   It has bindings to many common languages.

Including JAPI in your GCL build::
==================================

The GCL binding presented here is based on the C language version of the
library, statically linked into GCL and uses the standard GCL FFI macros
to import the functions and constants provided by JAPI.

   To include the library in your build of GCL, simply download the
version of JAPI needed for your computer system, install the headers and
libraries, and add the GCL configure switch "-enable-japi=yes" to your
usual configuration parameters.  Build GCL as usual.

   To run the GUI from GCL programs, you do need to have either of the
executables "java" or "jre" in your PATH.

How it works::
==============

As downloaded from the above web site, JAPI uses a socket connection to
a Java GUI which is, fortunately for us, invisible to GCL. This gives
the GCL JAPI binding the advantages and disadvantages of any non-native
GUI system which trades off portability, speed and OS specific look and
feel.

   The GCL JAPI binding works on Windows which is it's main advantage
over GCL-Tk other than ease of maintenance at the Lisp level.

   The main disadvantage of GCL JAPI relative to GCL-Tk is that the JAPI
library is no longer actively developed.  It has also been criticised
for depending on Java, a proprietary system.

   This binding does nothing more than provide Lisp wrappers around the
JAPI primitives; there are no higher order functional wrappers.
Never-the-less the interface is easy to understand, maintain and use at
the Lisp level.

   The documentation for JAPI available from the web site is pretty much
all you need to get started with the library under GCL. All of the
exposed library functions and constants are provided in GCL and a
comprehensive example is provided here to give you some idea of how to
start using the system.

   Here is a simple example of how to use JAPI. It displays an empty
frame for five seconds and then kills the GUI.

     ;; Run a five second frame in a Japi server
     (with-server ("GCL Japi library test GUI 1" 0)
     	     (with-frame (frame "Five Second Blank Test Frame")
     			 (j_show frame)
     			 (j_sleep 5000)))

   The macros "with-server" and "with-frame" are defined in the larger
example below.

   The first, "with-server", takes two arguments, an application name
string and a debug level.  With debug level zero there is no debug
output on the console.

   The second, "with-frame" takes two arguments, a variable name and a
frame title string.  You use the variable name, here "frame", to refer
to the frame in later function calls.

   The longer example below which includes the small example just
explained, also displays various kinds of dialog, does some graphics and
mouse handling including the ability to save graphics to disk, and shows
one way of implementing a very simple text editor.

Example::

     ;;;     http://www.japi.de/
     ;;;
     ;;; This file shows how to use some of the available functions.  You may assume
     ;;; that the only functions tested so far in the binding are those which appear
     ;;; below, as this file doubles as the test program.  The binding is so simple
