<p>The product life cycle includes design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance. In the past, optimization of products focused on the design phase, often overlooking issues that arose in manufacturing, operation, and maintenance. This is where digital twins can help - by extending optimization across the entire product lifecycle. With digital twins, problems can be identified and solved not just in design, but even after production during real-world use. This allows products to be greatly improved through rapid iteration. Digital twins may thus accelerate innovations like manned missions to Mars. </p>

<p>The FENGSim project is an adaptive manufacturing operation system.
1. Interfaces for mathematical libraries such as computational geometry, computer algebra, numerical methods, numerical linear algebra, computer graphics and image processing, probability and statistics, optimization, etc, and software framework.
2. Tools for library dependences, package management, CICD (compile, code merge, version control, test, deploy).
3. Interfaces for equipments and sensors such as communications, drivers, job management.
4. Physical simulations for manufacturing technologies.</p>

<p>To install:
1. Navigate to the cli directory in your terminal/command prompt.
2. Run the install script by entering:
    ./install.sh
3. Once installation is complete, launch QtCreator with:
    ./qtcreator.sh 
4. In QtCreator, open the FENGSim.pro project file located at:
    starters/FENGSim/FENGSim.pro
5. Build the prepost module project in QtCreator.</p>
