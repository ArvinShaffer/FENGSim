# ABOUT OPEN DIGITAL TWIN

Please run ./install.sh in cli directory. After the installation, you could run ./qtcreator.sh to open QtCreator and open FENGSim.pro in starters/FENGSim directory to compile the prepost module.  

The product life cycle includes the design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance. In old times, the optimization for products is in the design step, but there are many problems in the manufacturing, operation and maintenance which are not solved. So we need the digital twin to extend the optimization throught the whole product life cycle. This improves the products greatly and speed the iteration greatly. Then human being will go to the mars quickly. 

The core for the digital twin is CAX technologies which includes computer aided desigen, engineering, manufacturing and inspection. The opencaxplus project is our study for the knowledge of open source software, physics, mathematics and computer. We collect many open source software to build the whole knowledge system and develop the software development toolkit. This SDK is very easy to use, by using use one command, the users could get the development environment, all the codes, tools, software framework and cases. It will be very easy for the researchers of alrogithms and mechanics to build their software produces. Based on the SDK, we deveopment the open digital twin proejct for important applications, such as additive manufacturing, composited materials, robots, measuring. You are welcome to join the opencaxplus project and the open digital twin project.
