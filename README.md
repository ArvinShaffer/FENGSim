# About Open Source Digital Twin

Digital Twins need all CAX technologies. Without a large team and big money, it is normally difficult and nearly impossible to develop a digital twin system like Siemens TeamCenter, Dassault 3D Experience, and Ansys WorkBench. But we've proven that open-source software is a good solution to this and it brings its products directly to the industrial sector. The open source digital twin project includes FENGSim, FASP, and OpenCAEPoro. FENGSim was initiated by Prof. Anders Logg and Dr. Jiping Xin from 2016. FASP and OpenCAEPoro were initiated by Associate Prof. Chensong Zhang.

# Cosmic Cube
By using just one command, you could open the door to the world of CAX and Digital Twin. 

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenDigitalTwin-Dev/OpenDigitalTwin/main/cube.x && sudo chmod 777 cube.x && ./cube.x`

You will get all the codes of CAX software and the development environment.
